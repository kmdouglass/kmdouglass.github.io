    <p>
The fluorescence microscopy setup in my lab requires quite a bit of
power. The minimum irradiance requirement is greater than 1 kW per
square centimeter, and this must cover an area spanning a few tens of
microns across after focusing through the objective. When I was
designing the setup, the highest priority was placed on finding a
cheap laser with as much power as possible at a wavelength of 647 nm;
I considered all other qualities of the laser of secondary importance.
</p>

<p>
Just like everything else in science, I have learned a very good
lesson from this experience. The laser I decided to purchase is a <a href="http://www.omicron-laser.de/english/lasers/diode-lasers/brixx-lasers/brixx-diode-lasers.html">800
mW BrixX laser from Omicron</a>. The cost is under $10,000, which I
consider to be a pretty good deal for the amount of power it puts
out. There is no fiber-coupled version, but all of our lasers are free
space anyway so I did not consider this to be a big problem. The beam
is astigmatic, which is to be expected from a high power laser diode.
</p>

<p>
The astigmatism is not necessarily a big problem for me, though. What
is surprising to me is how difficult it is to keep the beam <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collimated_light">collimated</a>
over large distances, that is, to keep it roughly the same size as it
propagates. My application requires a fairly small beam size since the
exit pupil of the objective is only 6 millimeters in diameter. With
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_squared">M-squared</a> values direct from the laser of 12 and 25, it is quite
difficult to keep the beam collimated for a long enough distance to
steer the beam through all the optics and to keep it small enough to
prevent overfilling the objective's exit pupil and losing power.
</p>

<p>
What I have learned from this is that free-space diode lasers, and
more generally multimode laser beams, require extra consideration to
ensure that they will stay collimated in long setups.
</p>

<p>
So, how can I predict the distance over which my beam can stay
collimated to better judge how well it will work for my setup? The
first thing to realize is that no beam can stay collimated
forever. Real laser beams experience diffraction, which causes them to
spread as they propagate. This means that the first thing I should do
is to consider the distances spanned by the beam paths. In a
microscopy setup, this path will probably not be longer than a couple
meters. In mine, it's roughly two meters since I am combining a number
of laser beams together and need the extra space.
</p>

<p>
Once I identify the length scale over which the beam should stay
collimated, I need to examine the beam parameter that is best
associated with collimation. For a pure Gaussian beam, this parameter
is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_length">Rayleigh range</a>. The Rayleigh range is the distance between the
beam waist and the point where the cross-sectional area of the beam
has doubled, or, equivalently, to the point where the radius of the
beam has increased over the waist radius by a factor of the
\(\sqrt{2}\). For a pure Gaussian beam with a waist radius of \(w_0\) and
a wavelength of \(\lambda\), the Rayleigh range is given by the equation
</p>


\begin{equation*}
z_R = \frac{\pi w_0^2}{\lambda}
\end{equation*}

<p>
It is represented by the symbol <i>z<sub>R</sub></i> in the figure below from
Wikipedia. The total distance over which the beam will stay collimated
is represented by <i>b</i> and is just twice the Rayleigh range.
</p>

<div align="center">


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="GaussianBeamWaist.png" alt="GaussianBeamWaist.png"></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>
The Rayleigh range of a Gaussian laser beam should therefore be larger
than the characteristic distance of my setup that I identified in the
previous step. But what about multimode beams like the one from my
laser diode? This is where the concept of an "embedded Gaussian" comes
into play. (For more information about this idea, see <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.177.3400&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">this tutorial by
Tony Siegman</a>.) I can predict the collimated distance by computing the
Rayleigh range of an ideal Gaussian beam, and then divide it by the
M<sup>2</sup> parameter for the beam.
</p>

<p>
Let's take an example using numbers from my own laser. I will first
pretend there are no collimating optics in the laser, which is not
true but will serve as a good example as to why diode lasers without
collimating optics are not good for free space setups. From the
laser's spec sheet, I know that the M<sup>2</sup> value in the ``bad'' direction
is 25 and that its waist size, which is probably half the size of the
diode in one principle direction, is 107 microns. Using the above
equation, I get a value of 56 centimeters, which means that an ideal
Gaussian beam with these specs will stay collimated over about half a
meter.
</p>

<p>
However, my real multimode beam will have a Rayleigh range that is
smaller than this value by a factor of 25, which is only about 2
centimeters. For this reason, diode laser beams almost always have
collimating optics; the beam from the diode itself is highly
divergent.
</p>

<p>
Returning to my own setup, if I resize the beam using a telescope to
have a waist radius of 2 millimeters so it almost entirely fits inside
the objective's exit pupil, the Rayleigh range of the embedded
Gaussian beam will be almost <i>20 meters</i>, which is pretty long. The
real beam, however, will have a Rayleigh range of about 780
millimeters meters due to the high M<sup>2</sup> value. <b>Practically, this means
I have about one meter of collimated laser beam</b> with which to work
since I have double the Rayleigh range of collimated distance, but
really I want the beam to travel less distance than this.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately I can shrink the beam path enough that this should not be
a problem, but it does serve as a very good lesson when looking for
lasers for a microscopy application.

As a microscopist who designs and builds custom microscopes, I often
find that first order ray tracing is one of the most useful tools I
have. It is most useful to me when I am starting a design or for
checking that I have not made any serious logical blunders when
working at the bench. I also find it to be a good teaching tool and
excellent for communicating my designs to others.
</p>

<p>
Since I have recently made a lot of back-of-the-envelope ray trace
designs for a microscope I am building at work, I have begun to
critically think about why ray tracing works so well and how it fits
inside the structure of the physical theories of optics.
</p>

<p>
Ray tracing is a technique derived from <b>paraxial geometrical optics</b>
and really is just a consequence of the axioms and assumptions in the
development of the theory. When I think back to when I first learned
about paraxial optics, however, I am reminded of severe assumptions
that place limits on the scope of its validity. So how can a theory
that makes such an enormous simplification by treating the
electromagnetic waves described by Maxwell's equations as lines
obeying the rules of geometry still be so useful?
</p>

<p>
In this next series of blog posts, I want to explore this question and
take the time to relearn paraxial optics with the benefit of
hindsight. Physicists typically learn paraxial optics as their first
theory of optics because it is relatively easy as compared to
electromagnetism and quantum optics. I am curious what aspects of the
theory I can appreciate now that I am familiar with the more advanced
optical theories.
</p>

<p>
The picture below might also provide a bit of motivation for why this
interests me: we physicists learn about optics theories in a direction
of increasing complexity during our education. However, this approach
also means that we learn the most general theories last, so it is not
obvious why assumptions and approximations are made in the theories we
learn first. The result, I think, leads to a bit of logical
discordance in our minds that can prevent a clear understanding of the
subject. With this series of posts I hope to remove this cognitive
dissonance and improve my understanding of the field I work in.

<a href="https://gist.github.com/kmdouglass/507717d339bc82f850ce">I just created a Python Gist</a> for reading select lines from a text file
into memory. I came up with this Gist when I needed to parse the core
log from our <a href="https://www.micro-manager.org/">microscope control software (Micro-Manager)</a>. One of our
devices was continously sending its statistics to the computer, which
would then be recorded to the log. I wanted to find only lines that
contained the statistics by searching for the <b>STATS</b> identifier,
which was unique to these lines.
</p>

<p>
The problem was a bit more difficult than reading just the lines
containing this string because I wanted the statistics only for times
when the software was acquiring a time series of images. Luckily, the
core log also contains lines with unique strings indicating when a
time series was initiated and stopped. All lines in the log are
time-stamped.
</p>

<p>
Below is the Gist I used to solve this problem. The lines that will be
retained in memory will contain the strings in the list lineFilters. I
then define a function named stringIsIn that will return a list of
bool indicating whether each string is present in the line.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the Gist, I use a list comprehension to loop over
each line in the file. The line is appended to a growing list called
outputLines if the line contains <i>any</i> of the strings I defined. Note
that it's not necessary to use a separate definition for stringIsIn;
the list comprehension over lineFilters could have been placed inline
with the primary list comprension over lines in the file. I do think
it is more readable the way it is presented below, however.
</p>

<p>
I welcome any comments or suggestions, especially on the <a href="https://gist.github.com/kmdouglass/507717d339bc82f850ce">Gist website</a>
where others may be more likely to find it.

    <p>
I use Python 3.4 in most of my data analyses and in some
simulations. I like a lot of its features, like its implementation of
generators, maps, and filters. However, much of the software on my
Debian Wheezy system depends on Python 2.7 to run, such as
<a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>. (It used to run just fine with Python 3.4, until I ran an
automatic update and that was the end of that.)
</p>

<p>
To run some Python 2.7 programs, I used to do the following:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo rm /usr/bin/python 
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python
</pre></div>

<p>
I know. Ouch. Every single time I needed to run a program that
depended on python2.7, I would delete the symlink in /usr/bin, make a
new link to python2.7, and then run my program. When I needed to give
various programs convenient access to python3.4, I would delete the
symlink and create a new one to the newer version.
</p>

<p>
This was dumb, because there is a convenient Python-based tool that
can fix the problem of needing multiple versions of Python (and
libraries!) on the same system. The solution to this problem is called
<a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of descriptions about what virtualenv is on the
internet, so I won't bother going into details here. Instead, I will
focus on just the very basics of its setup and use so that I can have
a handy future reference for when I forget how something works and so
that others can profit from what I have learned. Most everything I've
done came from <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/">python-guide.org</a>, so I'm more-or-less putting <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">what they
have already said</a> into my own words.
</p>

<p>
To start, I already have Python 2.7 and 3.4 installed on my system. In
principle, you do not need them installed at the system level, but I
already have done this so I will start from there. I first installed
pip for Python 2.7 since I only had pip3 on my system to start. I did
this because I want to keep Python 2.7 as my system's default Python
environment.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-pip
</pre></div>

<p>
Once installed, I used it to install virtualenv and
<a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">virtualenvwrapper</a>. The latter provides some nice features for working
with virtualenv.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo pip install virtualenv
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
</pre></div>

<p>
Now, virtualenvwrapper requires an environment variable to tell it
where to store the folders for each virtual environment. This
environment variable is called WORKON_HOME. First, I created the
folder it will point to:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir ~/Envs
</pre></div>

<p>
Next, I edited my ~/.bashrc and added the following line:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">WORKON_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>~/Envs
</pre></div>

<p>
All of my virtual environment files (except for the Python
intepreters) will be stored in this folder. Finally, I restarted my
terminal window so that the environment variable was assigned. You can
check this by typing <code>echo $WORKON_HOME</code> in your new terminal
window. If it returns the path to your new environments folder, then
you should be fine.
</p>

<p>
Next, I ran the virtualwrapper setup script. Note that I did not need
sudo (in fact, sudo could not find a command called ``source'') and
that no output is returned when the script is run.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">source</span> /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
</pre></div>

<p>
Now virtualenvwrapper should be installed, so let's make a virtual
environment. We can do this using the <code>mkvirtualenv</code> command, followed
by a name for the environment. I will use the name ``venv'' in this
example, like Kenneth Reitz did in his guide that I linked above.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>mkvirtualenv venv
</pre></div>

<p>
To start the new virtual environment, type <code>workon venv</code> and note that
change in the prompt, indicating which environment you are in. You now
have a fresh Python environment to which you can add any library you
wish. To leave the environment, type <code>deactivate</code> into your terminal.
</p>

<p>
One simple test that you can do to see whether your Python environment
really is clean is to run the Python interpreter from inside your
environment and try importing a module that you know is in your
system-wide site packages but not in your virtual environment. For
example, inside venv I type <code>python</code> at the terminal prompt and tried
importing numpy, which I had not yet installed in venv:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
This returned an <b>ImportError: No module named numpy</b>. Since I do have
numpy installed on my system but not in this environment, it tells me
that the environment is likely clean.
</p>

<p>
To install new libraries, simply use pip or install them to the folder
that was created for this environment in ~/Env. To delete a virtual
environment entirely, use <code>rmvirtual env</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now, how can I specify that I want the virtual environment to use the
python3.4 interpreter in a virtual environment named
``python3-general''? Doing so would solve my original problem. Simply
make a new virtual environment like so:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mkvirtualenv</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">usr</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nb">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">python3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="n">python3</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">general</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Voilà. C'est tout. I hope this helps you get up and running with this
great tool!

<a href="http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2012/jul/1/python-decorators-in-12-steps/">Python's decorators</a> are tools for changing the behavior of a function
without completely recoding it. When we apply a decorator to a
function, we say that the function has been decorated. Strictly
speaking, when we decorate a function, we send it to a wrapper that
returns another function. It's as simple as that.
</p>

<p>
I was having trouble understanding exactly to which function, the
original or the decorated one, the arguments are sent in a Python
decorated function call. I wrote the following script to better
understand this process (I use Python 3.4):
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">wrapper</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">inFunction</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">outFunction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">):</span>
	<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'The input arguments were:'</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">():</span>
	    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'</span><span class="si">%r</span><span class="s"> : </span><span class="si">%r</span><span class="s">'</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">))</span>

	<span class="c"># Return the original function</span>
	<span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">inFunction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">outFunction</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
<code>wrapper(inFunction)</code> is a function that accepts another function as
an argument. It returns a function that simply prints the keyword
arguments of <i>inFunction()</i>, and calls <i>inFunction()</i> like normal.
</p>

<p>
To decorate the function <i>add(x = 1, y = 2)</i> so that its arguments are
printed without recoding it, we normally would place <code>@wrapper</code> before
its definition. However, let's make the decorator in a way that's
closer to how <i>@</i> works under the hood:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>In [22]: decoratedAdd = wrapper(add)
In [23]: decoratedAdd(x = 1, y = 24)
The input arguments were:
'y' : 24
'x' : 1
Out[23]: 25
</pre></div>

<p>
When we call <i>decoratedAdd(x = 1, y = 24)</i>, the arguments are printed
to the screen and we still get the same functionality of <i>add()</i>. What
I wanted to know was this: are the keyword arguments x = 1, y = 24
bound in the namespace of <i>wrapper()</i> or in the namespace of
<i>outFunction()</i>? <b>In otherwords, does <i>wrapper()</i> at any point know
what the arguments are that I send to the decorated function?</b>
</p>

<p>
The answer, as it turns out, is no in this case. This is because the
<i>wrapper()</i> function first returns the decorated function, and then
the arguments are passed into the decorated function. If this order of
operations were flipped, <i>wrapper()</i> should know that I set x to 1 and
y to 24, but really it doesn't know these details at all.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>In [24]: wrapper(add)(x = 1, y = 24)
The input arguments were:
'y' : 24
'x' : 1
Out[24]: 25
</pre></div>

<p>
So, when I call <i>wrapper(add)(x = 1, y = 24)</i>, first <i>wrapper(add)</i> is
called, which returns <i>outFunction()</i>, and then these arguments are
passed to <i>outFunction()</i>.
</p>

<p>
Now what happens when I call <code>wrapper(add(x = 1, y = 24))</code>? When I try
this, the arguments are first passed into add, but then <i>outFunction</i>
is returned without any arguments applied to it.
</p>

<p>
This example can give us an idea about the working order of operations
in Python. Here, this example reveals that function calls in Python
are left-associative.

I've been sitting in on a short lecture series presented by <a href="http://markolab.bmbcb.northwestern.edu/marko/">Prof. John
Marko</a> here at the EPFL. The topic is on the biophysics of DNA and
covers what is probably at least a 25 year span of research that has
emerged on its mechanical and biochemical properties.
</p>

<p>
DNA amazes me in two different ways: relatively simple physical
theories can explain <i>in vitro</i> experiments, but establishing a
complete understanding of the behavior of DNA and its associated
proteins (collectively known as chromatin) <i>in vivo</i> seems at this
point almost hopeless.
</p>

<p>
So why do I think it's so difficult to establish a complete physical
theory of the nucleus?
</p>

<p>
Certainly a lot of recent research has helped us to understand parts
of what happens inside the nucleus. Take for example recent
experiments that look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor#Accessibility_of_DNA-binding_site">transcription factor</a> (TF) binding and the
nuclear architecture. TF binding experiments have helped us understand
the mechanism of how a single transcription factor ``searches'' for a
target site on a chromosome. It undergoes diffusion in the crowded
nuclear environment, occasionally binding to the DNA non-specifically
and sliding along it. We now know that this combined diffusion/sliding
mechanism produces an optimum search strategy.
</p>

<p>
Studies of nuclear architecture attempt to understand how the long DNA
polymer, which is on the order of <i>one meter</i> long, is packaged into
the nucleus, which is only about <i>five micrometers</i> in diameter. This
is nearly six orders of magnitude of compaction. Some current theories
treat the DNA as a hierarchically packaged polymer or a fractal
structure. Interestingly, the fractal model can <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24380602">explain why TF's may
diffuse optimally</a> and when crowding can hinder their search.
</p>

<p>
Both of these examples represent a generalization of one particular
phenomenon that occurs inside the nucleus. And even given the enormity
of these works, I think this generalization can be dubious because it
may not apply to all cell types and there may be differences between
cultured cells and those found in an actual organism.
</p>

<p>
The problem in capturing complete physical models of the nucleus seems
to lie with the philosophy of physics itself: find the most essential
parts of the system and include those in your model, discarding all
irrelevant details. Unfortunately, <i>in vitro</i> experiments suggest that
every detail seems to matter inside the nucleus. Local salt
concentrations effect electrostatic interactions and entropic binding
between proteins and DNA, the global nuclear architecture has an
effect on single TF's diffusing inside the nucleus, there are a huge
number of proteins that associate with DNA and control the
conformation in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22495300">toplogically associating domains</a>. The list goes on and
on.
</p>

<p>
A common theme to this list that I have described above is that
phenomena at one length scale tend to have a direct impact on those at
another, like the global nuclear architecture affecting a single TF
trajectory. These are hallmarks of complexity: a dependence on the
details of a system and multiscale behavior.
</p>

<p>
I am currently of the opinion that a complete model of the nucleus,
and probably of other biological systems, must therefore necessarily
abandon one important part of physical theories: reduction to the
simplest possible set of parameters to describe a system. We need to
incorporate all the details across all length scales to reproduce what
exactly is going on.
</p>

<p>
And if classical physics falls short of this goal, what other
approaches do we then require?

I've been doing a bit of programming work lately that would greatly
benefit from a speed boost using parallel/concurrent processing
tools. Essentially, I'm doing a <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/examples/parallel-simulations-using-parfor-parameter-sweep-in-normal-mode.html">parameter sweep</a> where the values for
two different simulation parameters are input into the simulation and
allowed to run with the results being recorded to disk at the end. The
point is to find out how the simulation results vary with the
parameter values.
</p>

<p>
In my current code, a new simulation is initialized with each pair of
parameter values inside one iteration of a for loop; each iteration of
the loop is independent of the others. Spreading these iterations over
the 12 cores on my workstation should result in about a 12x decrease
in the amount of time the simulation takes to run.
</p>

<p>
I've had good success using the <code>parfor</code> loop construct in Matlab in
the past, but my simulation was written in Python and I want to learn
more about Python's multiprocessing tools, so this post will explore
that module in the context of performing parameter sweeps.

First, I profiled my code to identify where any slowdowns might be
occurring in the serial program. I used a great tutorial at the <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/profiling-python-boss/">Zapier
Engineering</a> blog to write a decorator for profiling the main instance
method of my class that was doing most of the work. Surprisingly, I
found that a few numpy methods were taking the most time, namely
<b>norm()</b> and <b>cross()</b>. To address this, I directly imported the
Fortran BLAS <b>nrm2()</b> function using scipy's <b>get_blas_funcs()</b>
function and hard-coded the cross product in pure Python inside the
method; these two steps alone resulted in a 4x decrease in simulation
time. I suspect the reason for this was because the overhead of
calling functions on small arrays outweighs the increase in speed
using Numpy's optimized C code. I was normalizing single vectors and
taking cross products between two vectors at a time many times during
each loop iteration.

<h2 id="sec-2">A brief glance at Python's multiprocessing module</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
<a href="http://pymotw.com/2/multiprocessing/basics.html">PyMOTW</a> has a good, minimal description of the main aspects of the
multiprocessing module. They state that the simplest way to create
tasks on different cores of a machine is to create new <b>Process</b>
objects with target functions. Each object is then set to execute by
calling its <b>start()</b> method.
</p>

<p>
The basic example from their site looks like this:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">multiprocessing</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">worker</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="sd">"""worker function"""</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">'Worker'</span>
    <span class="k">return</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">'__main__'</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">jobs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">):</span>
	<span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">multiprocessing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Process</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">target</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">worker</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">jobs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
In this example, it's important to create the Process instances inside
the
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">'__main__'</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
section of the script because child processes import the script where
the target function is contained. Placing the object instantiation in
this section prevents an infinite, recursive string of such
instantiations. A workaround to this is to define the function in a
different script and import it into the namespace.
</p>

<p>
To send arguments to the function (<b>worker()</b> in the example above),
we can use the <b>args</b> keyword in the Process object instantiation like
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(i,))
</pre></div>

<p>
A very important thing to note is that the arguments must be objects
that can be pickled using Python's pickle module. If an argument is a
class instance, this means that every attritube of that class must be
pickleable.
</p>

<p>
An important class in the multiprocessing module is a <b>Pool</b>. A <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.Pool">Pool</a>
object controls a pool of worker processes. Jobs can be submitted to
the Pool, which then sends the jobs to the individual workers.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Pool.map()</b> achieves the same functionality as Matlab's <b>parfor</b>
construct. This method essentially applies a function to each element
in an iterable and returns the results. For example, if I wanted to
square each number in a list of integers between 0 and 9 and perform
the square operation on multiple processors, I would write a function
for squaring an argument, and supply this function and the list of
integers to <b>Pool.map()</b>. The code looks like this:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">multiprocessing</span>

<p>
In my parameter sweep, I have two classes: one is an object that I'm
simulating and the other acts as a controller that sends parameters to
the structure and collects the results of the simulation. Everything
was written in a serial fashion and I want to change it so the bulk of
the work is performed in parallel.
</p>

<p>
After the bottlenecks were identified in the serial code, I began
thinking about how the the problem of parameter sweeps could be
addressed using the multiprocessing module.
</p>

<p>
The solution requirements I identified for my parameter sweep are as
follows:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Accept two values (one for each parameter) from the range of values
to test as inputs to the simulation.
</li>
<li>For each pair of values, run the simulation as an independent
process.
</li>
<li>Return the results of the simulation as as a list or Numpy array.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I often choose to return the results as Numpy arrays since I can
easily pickle them when saving to a disk. This may change depending on
your specific problem.

<p>
This is a rather silly example of a simulation, but I think it
illustrates the point nicely. In the <b><span class="underline"><span class="underline">main</span></span></b> portion of the code, I
first define two lists for each parameter value that I want to
'simulate.' These parameters are zipped together in this example
because <b>Pool.map()</b> takes only one iterable as its argument. The pool
is opened using with <b>multiprocessing.Pool()</b>.
</p>

<p>
Most of the work is performed in the function
<b>runSimulation(params)</b>. It takes a tuple of two parameters which are
unpacked. Then, these parameters are used in the for loop to build a
list of simulated values which is eventually returned.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the <b><span class="underline"><span class="underline">main</span></span></b> section, each simulation is run on a
different core of my machine using the <b>Pool.map()</b> function. This
applies the function called <b>runSimulation()</b> to the values in the
<b>params</b> iterable. In other words, it calls the code described in
<b>runSimulation()</b> with a different pair of values in params.
</p>

<p>
All the results are eventually returned in a list in the same order as
the parameter iterable. This means that the first element in the
<b>results</b> list corresponds to parameters of 0 and 2 in this example.

Again, this is a silly example, but it demonstrates that lists of
objects can be used in the parameter sweep, allowing for easy
parallelization of object-oriented code.
</p>

<p>
Instead of <b>runSimulation()</b>, you may want to apply an instance method
to a list in <b>pool.map()</b>. A naïve way to do this is to replace
<b>runSimulation</b> with with the method name but this too causes
problems. I won't go into the details here, but one solution is to use
an instance's <b>__call__()</b> method and pass the object instance into
the pool. More details can be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1816958/cant-pickle-type-instancemethod-when-using-pythons-multiprocessing-pool-ma">here</a>.

On my machine, <b>pool.map()</b> ran in 9.6 seconds, but the serial version

In Python, you have to prevent infinite, recursive function calls by

have to be sure that Numpy and other Python modules that use BLAS

implementation is the power of using Python as a general programming
language with a lot of tools for scientific computing. This and the

I work in microscopy, which is one form of optical sensing. In the
sensing field, we are often concerned with making measurements on
some structure so as to learn what it is. Often, I think the word
measurement refers to the dataset that's produced.
</p>

<p>
I think it can be more effective to think of a measurement as a
process that transforms the structure into the dataset. Why is this
so? Well, to understand what the original structure was, we have to
look at our data and make an inference. If we understand the steps
in the process that took the original structure and turned it into
data, we can apply the inverse of those steps in reverse order to
get the original structure.
</p>

<p>
Of course, our dataset may only capture some limited aspects of the
original structure, so we may only be able to make probabilistic
statements about what the original structure was.
</p>

<p>
Take, for example, super-resolution microscopy experiments (SR). In
SR, some feature of a cell is labeled with a discrete number of
fluorescent molecules, then these molecules are localized to a high
precision. The centroids of all the molecules are then convolved
with a Gaussian function (or something similar) with a width equal
to the localization precision to produce a rendered, super-resolved
image of the structure. The measurement process can be thought of
like this:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Attach fluorescent molecules to every macromolecule (or randomly
to a subset of macromolecules) in the structure of interest.
</li>
<li>For every molecule that emits photons during the time of
acqusition by one camera frame, record its true coordinate
positions and the number of detected photons. This can create
multiple localizations that correspond to the same molecule in
multiple camera frames.
</li>
<li>Remove molecules from the lis that emitted less than some
threshold number of photons. These correspond to molecules with a
signal-to-noise ratio that is too low to be detected.
</li>
<li>Randomly bump the molecule positions according to a Gaussian
distribution with width equal to the localization precision in
each direction.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This process results in a list of molecule positions that originally
were located on the structure of interest, but were eventually
displaced randomly and filtered out due to various sources of
noise. To understand what the original structure was, we have to
"undo" each of these steps to the best of our abilities.
</p>

<p>
I think it's interesting to note that everytime a random change to
the original molecule positions occurred, we lose some information
about the structure.

My PhD work dealt with the topic of sensing and imaging using light
that had been transmitted through a random medium. This topic is
often applied to practical problems such as imaging through a
turbulent atmosphere or detecting objects, like a tumor, buried
beneath an opaque substance, like skin and muscle tissue. Though I
don't necessarily work in this field anymore, I still follow its
developments occasionally.
</p>

<p>
A few articles appeared within the last week in journals like <a href="http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v8/n10/full/nphoton.2014.189.html">Nature</a>
Photonics]] about the problem of imaging through walls. This problem
has been studied since the late 1980's in a number of papers,
including the notable <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.834">Feng, Kane, Lee, and Stone</a> paper and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037596019090615U#">Freund's
discussion</a> of using cross-correlating two speckle patterns, one of
which is a reference wave, to do a sort of holographic imaging. The
recent work continues from these original ideas and applies them to
microscopy.
</p>

<p>
One article appeared on the arXiv and is from the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2079">Mosk and Lagendijk</a>
camp. In this article, they exploit the optical memory effect,
whereby a speckle pattern generated by the multiple scattering of a
plane wave by a random slab is simply translated as the angle of
incidence of the plane wave is varied. If a thin fluorescent target
is placed directly on the opposite face of the scattering slab, it
will be excited by the speckle pattern and emit a fluorescence
signal that can be captured by an objective. Changing the angle of
incidence of the plane wave then allows for multiple points to scan
the sample in parallel. Ultimately, a number of images are taken
with the sample illuminated by several transversally shifted speckle
patterns and the resulting 4D data cube (corresponding to the
sample's x-y dimensions and the two tilt angles of the incident
plane wave) is used to render an image with improved resolution.
</p>

<p>
As stated in the article's title, the resolution improvement is
relative to that of a widefield microscope. They obtain an effective
point spread function of about 140 nm and a field of view of 10
microns by 10 microns.
</p>

<p>
So how does the technique work? My first thought was that the memory
effect is simply another way of saying that the speckle pattern acts
as a number of confocal-like point sources, which essentially means
this is something of a parallelized confocal microscope. However,
I'm not sure this is correct for two reasons: 1) there is no
detection pin hole, and 2) the angle of incidence of the plane wave
is scanned over a small angular range so that the speckle pattern is
simply translated. If the angle of incidence is so great that the
linear change in phase of the plane wave is greater than roughly the
size of the scattering slab, the speckle pattern is no longer simply
translated but changes completely.
</p>

<p>
In reality, the ultimate resolution of this technique is the average
speckle grain size, which can't be less than about half the
wavelength. This suggests that the angular spectrum of the speckle
pattern is what determines the resolution improvement.
</p>

<p>
The speckle pattern in a region bounded by the maximum extent of the
memory effect has a fixed angular spectrum and translating the
speckle pattern only changes the phase of the spectrum. So, scanning
a target with a speckle pattern produces beat patterns containing
high spatial frequency information that can propgate on the low
spatial frequency waves that reach the objective. Translating the
speckle pattern then performs a sort of phase-shifting
interferometry that allows for both intensity and phase retrieval of
the object.
</p>

<p>
Importantly, if the speckle pattern is scanned outside the range of
the memory effect, the speckle's angular spectrum within the region
changes completely so that the original reference wave is lost. The
fact that the object is fluorescent and not simply scattering the
light shouldn't matter if the fluorescence intensity is linear with
the excitation light intensity. However, if the fluorescence has
saturated at the average intensity of the speckle pattern, then I'm
not exactly sure that this technique will work (though maybe some
sort of nonlinear structured illumination microscopy could be
achieved).
</p>

<p>
Overall it's a neat demonstration and worth the exercise to
understand it, though I'm doubtful that at this point it would be
useful for applications in the life sciences. This is because the
resolution isn't that much better than a spinning disk confocal
microscope, which has a larger field of view and would arguably be
easier to use by biologists.

    <p>
Recently in the lab we made a seemingly minor change to one of our
microscopes that led to a minor problem that lasted for about a
week. Briefly, we introduced a mirror following a periscope that
raises the plane that the laser beams travel in parallel to the
table. The periscope is necessary to bringthe beams out of the plane
containing the beam-combining optics and into the TIRF module port
on our Zeiss inverted microscope for epi-illumination.
</p>

<p>
We had introduced the mirror to give us one more degree of freedom
for steering the beam, but to do so we had to move the periscope and
turn one of the mirrors by 90 degrees. Unfortunately, after doing
this we found that the optical power leaving the microscope
objective had dropped by a factor of 10, which was insufficient to
do STORM imaging.
</p>

<p>
We eventually determined that the Zeiss TIRF module contained a
polarizing beam splitter that combined the laser beams with white
light from another port at 90 degrees to the beam path. In the
newsetup, we placed a broadband halfwave plate before the TIRF
module, rotated it while watching a power meter, and were finally
able to get even more power leaving the objective than with the old
setup.
</p>

<p>
So what had happened to cause the decrease in power by adding
another mirror, and why did introducing the halfwave plate fix the
problem? As it turns out, you can rotate the polarization by 90
degrees using only a pair of mirrors to redirect the beam into a
plane parallel to its original plane of travel but into a direction
perpendicular to its original one. This was what we were doing
before we introduced the mirror. After the new mirror was put in
place, we rotated a mirror of the periscope, which effectively
rotated the laser beam's polarization back into its original
orientation. And, since there was a polarizing beam splitter inside
the TIRF module, the new beam polarization was transmitted through
the module instead of being reflected towards the objective.
</p>

<p>
The picture below describes how this can happen. Note that the final
beam trajectory is in the direction pointing <i>into</i> the screen.
