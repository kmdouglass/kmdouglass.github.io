<p><strong>WARNING</strong> You can easily ruin your Raspberry Pi camera module by
following the steps in this post. Proceed with caution.</p>
<p>Over the past half year I have been making slow but steady progress on
<a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/project/19677-basic-lensless-imaging-for-low-cost-microscopy">my lensless imager project</a>. The
purpose, aside from having a bit of fun, is to create an imaging
system for basic cell biology that doesn't use an expensive microscope
objective.</p>
<p>A lensless imager works just as its name implies: an image sensor
records the scattered light from a microscopic, transparent object and
computationally reconstructs an image of that object, all without a
lens. The best resolutions are achieved when the object is relatively
close to the image sensor. Ideally, the separation between the object
and the sensor's pixels would be at most about one millimeter. <a class="reference external" href="http://innovate.ee.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/annurev-bioeng-092515-010849.pdf">This
limit is partly determined by the light source's spatial coherence</a>,
but also by the fact that high resolution is achieved by recording the
scattered light at very large angles, which is possible only when the
sample is close to the sensor.</p>
<p>Today I had a bit of free time so I decided to see whether I could
remove the housing that surrounds the Raspberry Pi camera's
sensor. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/">Raspberry Pi Camera Module version 2</a> sensor is a
Sony IMX219 color chip. Directly above the sensor is a filter, a lens,
and the housing for both of these that prevent me from placing
anything closer than about half a centimeter from the sensor plane. If
I would want to use this camera for the lensless imager, then the
housing would have to go.</p>
<p>Now, even without the housing the Raspberry Pi camera is not
necessarily the best option for the project because the IMX219 is a
color sensor. This means that there is a Bayer filter over its pixels,
which would cut the resolution of the imager since I would be using a
very narrow band light source. Effectively, only a quarter of the
pixels would be receiving any light. Regardless, I had a spare second
camera and it interfaces well with the Raspberry Pi, so I figured it
would make for a good prototype.</p>
<p>As you will see, I did slightly damage my sensor, though it seems to
still work. <strong>You can easily ruin your camera module or cut your
finger by following these steps, so proceed at your own risk.</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="step-0-the-raspberry-pi-camera-module-v2">
<h2>Step 0: The Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2</h2>
<p>In the picture below you see my Raspberry Pi Camera Module. From
above, you can see the small circular aperture with the lens
immediately behind it. The sensor is inside the small gray rectangular
housing that is attached to the control board by a small ribbon cable
(to its right) and a bit of two-sided sticky foam tape (underneath the
sensor; not visible).</p>
<img alt="The Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2" class="align-center" src="../../images/pi_camera_step0.thumbnail.jpg">
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-1-remove-the-main-ribbon-cable">
<h2>Step 1: Remove the main ribbon cable</h2>
<p>To make working on the board a bit easier, I removed the white ribbon
cable that attaches the module to the Pi. I did this by pulling on the
black tabs on the two ends of the connecter until the cable is easily
removed. I labeled the sides of the ribbon cable just in case.</p>
<img alt="Remove the main ribbon cable from the control board" class="align-center" src="../../images/pi_camera_step1.thumbnail.jpg">
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-2-detach-the-sensor-s-ribbon-cable">
<h2>Step 2: Detach the sensor's ribbon cable</h2>
<p>Next, I used my finger and thumb nail to remove the small ribbon cable
that attaches the sensor to the control board. I essentially applied a
small torque to the bottom edge of the connector until it just
"popped" up, as seen in the second image below.</p>
<img alt="The small ribbon cable from the sensor is to the right." class="align-center" src="../../images/pi_camera_step2.thumbnail.jpg">
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-3-remove-the-sensor-from-the-control-board">
<h2>Step 3: Remove the sensor from the control board</h2>
<p>In the third step, I used my thumbnail to gently pry the sensor from
the control board. The sensor is attached with some two-sided sticky
tape and may need a few minutes of work to come free.</p>
<img alt="Pull the sensor off the control board." class="align-center" src="../../images/pi_camera_step3.thumbnail.jpg">
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-4-remove-the-rectangular-housing">
<h2>Step 4: Remove the rectangular housing</h2>
<p><strong>In this step you risk cutting your finger, so please be careful.</strong></p>
<p>The housing around the sensor is glued. To remove it, you will need to
gently work a knife (or, better yet, a thin screw driver) between the
housing and the sensor board, taking care not to let the blade go too
far into the housing and possibly ruining one of the resistors or wire
bonds.</p>
<img alt="Cut carefully on one side of the housing." class="align-center" src="../../images/pi_camera_step4.thumbnail.jpg"><p>Once you get a knife between the two, try popping the housing off of
the sensor.</p>
<img alt="Once the edge is cut, pop the housing off." class="align-center" src="../../images/pi_camera_step4b.thumbnail.jpg"><p>When I did this I cut on three sides of the housing, but in retrospect
I should have only cut on the side opposite the ribbon cable and pried
the other sides loose. This is because I damaged a small resistor when
the knife blade went too far into the housing. You can see this below
and, at the same time, get an idea of the layout of the sensor board
so you know where you can and can't cut.</p>
<img alt="The resistor near the top of the board was damaged when cutting the housing." class="align-center" src="../../images/pi_camera_step4c.thumbnail.png"><p>If you have the normal version of the camera, then you can also find the IR blocking filter
inside the housing.</p>
<img alt="The IR blocking filter." class="align-center" src="../../images/pi_camera_step4d.thumbnail.jpg"><p>Fortunately for me the camera still works, despite the damaged
resistor. I can now place samples directly on the sensor if I wanted
to, though the wire bonds from the sensor to its control board appear
quite fragile. For this reason, it may make more sense to build a
slide holder that holds a sample just above the surface without
touching it. For now, I can use this exposed sensor to prototype
different methods for mounting the sample.</p>
