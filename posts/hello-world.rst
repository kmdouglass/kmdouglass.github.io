.. description: The start of a new site
.. type: text

Well, I've finally got this site off the ground... more or less.

This website is the continuation of my blog, `My Quad-Ruled Life
<http://quadrule.blogspot.com>`_. On that site, I explored a number of topics as a graduate student
in optics, while improving my writing as well. As the site progressed and I matured academically, I
found that I was blogging less often, but still used the blog as a means of exploring
ideas. Additionally, I desired a place to present notes and code to the public in an easily
accessible and open manner.

So, after discovering `Nikola <http://getnikola.com/>`_ and `GitHub Pages
<http://pages.github.com/>`_, I quickly hashed together a fully homemade site that allowed me to
keep writing blog posts and to present some of the fruits of my research freely on the internet.

I hope you'll find this site useful as a learning resource and as a
means to get to know me better as a scientist.
