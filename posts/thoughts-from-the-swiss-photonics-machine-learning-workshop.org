#+END_COMMENT

Today I attended a [[http://www.swissphotonics.net/workshops/workshop-datenbank?2886][machine learning workshop hosted by Swiss
Photonics]]. The workshop was a small, day-long series of talks by
industry experts in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, not far from Lausanne. I
went to the workshop because a) I don't know much about machine
learning and want to know more, and b) I wanted to connect with people
within the Swiss Photonics circle. Most of the talks concerned deep
learning for solving problems in industrial machine vision
applications, such as quality control for the watch-making industry.

Here are the main things I learned, which may or not be correct. I
welcome any opinions or corrections in the comments:

+ The term "learning" is used to mean "teaching a computer to
  recognize and classify patterns in data", such as finding people in
  images.
+ Learning involves finding patterns in data. Once patterns are
  idenfitied, a set of them can be combined to form a model. A model
  makes predictions about what future data may look like. This means
  that a model may be used to see whether new data meets our
  expectations. An example would be using pictures of products from a
  production line and searching for defects, i.e. those products that
  don't fit our classification of "good" products.
+ Learning applications require lots of training data to
  implement. This is where the primary cost of applying learning
  algorithms comes from.
+ There are three categories of learning: supervised, reinforced, and
  unsupervised.
+ The value in neural networks is their ability to make decisions in a
  way that is similar to humans. Other classification and decision
  algorithms work using strict programmatic rules and look for
  user-specified features. Neural networks do not require domain
  knowledge to establish features for a classifier. Their generality
  is their strength.
+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning][Deep learning]] just refers to really big neural networks. Neural
  networks are not new; recent hardware advances like GPU-based
  computation and the availability of large datasets are what has
  enabled Deep learning.

I did not hear much discussion about the tradeoffs and downsides to
using neural networks or deep learning, other than that they require
large amounts of training data. Notable talks were given by Reto Wyss
of [[http://www.vidi-systems.com/company/about-us.html][ViDi]] and Virginie Moser of [[http://www.csem.ch/site/][CSEM]]. Wyss very eloquently explained
why deep learning is useful for classification. Moser presented an
extremely small and light-weight embedded machine vision system for
traffic light control.
