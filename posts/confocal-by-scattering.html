My PhD work dealt with the topic of sensing and imaging using light
that had been transmitted through a random medium. This topic is
often applied to practical problems such as imaging through a
turbulent atmosphere or detecting objects, like a tumor, buried
beneath an opaque substance, like skin and muscle tissue. Though I
don't necessarily work in this field anymore, I still follow its
developments occasionally.
</p>

<p>
A few articles appeared within the last week in journals like <a href="http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v8/n10/full/nphoton.2014.189.html">Nature</a>
Photonics]] about the problem of imaging through walls. This problem
has been studied since the late 1980's in a number of papers,
including the notable <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.834">Feng, Kane, Lee, and Stone</a> paper and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037596019090615U#">Freund's
discussion</a> of using cross-correlating two speckle patterns, one of
which is a reference wave, to do a sort of holographic imaging. The
recent work continues from these original ideas and applies them to
microscopy.
</p>

<p>
One article appeared on the arXiv and is from the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2079">Mosk and Lagendijk</a>
camp. In this article, they exploit the optical memory effect,
whereby a speckle pattern generated by the multiple scattering of a
plane wave by a random slab is simply translated as the angle of
incidence of the plane wave is varied. If a thin fluorescent target
is placed directly on the opposite face of the scattering slab, it
will be excited by the speckle pattern and emit a fluorescence
signal that can be captured by an objective. Changing the angle of
incidence of the plane wave then allows for multiple points to scan
the sample in parallel. Ultimately, a number of images are taken
with the sample illuminated by several transversally shifted speckle
patterns and the resulting 4D data cube (corresponding to the
sample's x-y dimensions and the two tilt angles of the incident
plane wave) is used to render an image with improved resolution.
</p>

<p>
As stated in the article's title, the resolution improvement is
relative to that of a widefield microscope. They obtain an effective
point spread function of about 140 nm and a field of view of 10
microns by 10 microns.
</p>

<p>
So how does the technique work? My first thought was that the memory
effect is simply another way of saying that the speckle pattern acts
as a number of confocal-like point sources, which essentially means
this is something of a parallelized confocal microscope. However,
I'm not sure this is correct for two reasons: 1) there is no
detection pin hole, and 2) the angle of incidence of the plane wave
is scanned over a small angular range so that the speckle pattern is
simply translated. If the angle of incidence is so great that the
linear change in phase of the plane wave is greater than roughly the
size of the scattering slab, the speckle pattern is no longer simply
translated but changes completely.
</p>

<p>
In reality, the ultimate resolution of this technique is the average
speckle grain size, which can't be less than about half the
wavelength. This suggests that the angular spectrum of the speckle
pattern is what determines the resolution improvement.
</p>

<p>
The speckle pattern in a region bounded by the maximum extent of the
memory effect has a fixed angular spectrum and translating the
speckle pattern only changes the phase of the spectrum. So, scanning
a target with a speckle pattern produces beat patterns containing
high spatial frequency information that can propgate on the low
spatial frequency waves that reach the objective. Translating the
speckle pattern then performs a sort of phase-shifting
interferometry that allows for both intensity and phase retrieval of
the object.
</p>

<p>
Importantly, if the speckle pattern is scanned outside the range of
the memory effect, the speckle's angular spectrum within the region
changes completely so that the original reference wave is lost. The
fact that the object is fluorescent and not simply scattering the
light shouldn't matter if the fluorescence intensity is linear with
the excitation light intensity. However, if the fluorescence has
saturated at the average intensity of the speckle pattern, then I'm
not exactly sure that this technique will work (though maybe some
sort of nonlinear structured illumination microscopy could be
achieved).
</p>

<p>
Overall it's a neat demonstration and worth the exercise to
understand it, though I'm doubtful that at this point it would be
useful for applications in the life sciences. This is because the
resolution isn't that much better than a spinning disk confocal
microscope, which has a larger field of view and would arguably be
easier to use by biologists.
