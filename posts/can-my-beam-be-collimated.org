The fluorescence microscopy setup in my lab requires quite a bit of
power. The minimum irradiance requirement is greater than 1 kW per
square centimeter, and this must cover an area spanning a few tens of
microns across after focusing through the objective. When I was
designing the setup, the highest priority was placed on finding a
cheap laser with as much power as possible at a wavelength of 647 nm;
I considered all other qualities of the laser of secondary importance.

Just like everything else in science, I have learned a very good
lesson from this experience. The laser I decided to purchase is a [[http://www.omicron-laser.de/english/lasers/diode-lasers/brixx-lasers/brixx-diode-lasers.html][800
mW BrixX laser from Omicron]]. The cost is under $10,000, which I
consider to be a pretty good deal for the amount of power it puts
out. There is no fiber-coupled version, but all of our lasers are free
space anyway so I did not consider this to be a big problem. The beam
is astigmatic, which is to be expected from a high power laser diode.

The astigmatism is not necessarily a big problem for me, though. What
is surprising to me is how difficult it is to keep the beam [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collimated_light][collimated]]
over large distances, that is, to keep it roughly the same size as it
propagates. My application requires a fairly small beam size since the
exit pupil of the objective is only 6 millimeters in diameter. With
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_squared][M-squared]] values direct from the laser of 12 and 25, it is quite
difficult to keep the beam collimated for a long enough distance to
steer the beam through all the optics and to keep it small enough to
prevent overfilling the objective's exit pupil and losing power.

What I have learned from this is that free-space diode lasers, and
more generally multimode laser beams, require extra consideration to
ensure that they will stay collimated in long setups.

So, how can I predict the distance over which my beam can stay
collimated to better judge how well it will work for my setup? The
first thing to realize is that no beam can stay collimated
forever. Real laser beams experience diffraction, which causes them to
spread as they propagate. This means that the first thing I should do
is to consider the distances spanned by the beam paths. In a
microscopy setup, this path will probably not be longer than a couple
meters. In mine, it's roughly two meters since I am combining a number
of laser beams together and need the extra space.

Once I identify the length scale over which the beam should stay
collimated, I need to examine the beam parameter that is best
associated with collimation. For a pure Gaussian beam, this parameter
is the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_length][Rayleigh range]]. The Rayleigh range is the distance between the
beam waist and the point where the cross-sectional area of the beam
has doubled, or, equivalently, to the point where the radius of the
beam has increased over the waist radius by a factor of the
$\sqrt{2}$. For a pure Gaussian beam with a waist radius of $w_0$ and
a wavelength of $\lambda$, the Rayleigh range is given by the equation


\begin{equation*}
z_R = \frac{\pi w_0^2}{\lambda}
\end{equation*}

It is represented by the symbol /z_R/ in the figure below from
Wikipedia. The total distance over which the beam will stay collimated
is represented by /b/ and is just twice the Rayleigh range.

The Rayleigh range of a Gaussian laser beam should therefore be larger
than the characteristic distance of my setup that I identified in the
previous step. But what about multimode beams like the one from my
laser diode? This is where the concept of an "embedded Gaussian" comes
into play. (For more information about this idea, see [[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.177.3400&rep=rep1&type=pdf][this tutorial by
Tony Siegman]].) I can predict the collimated distance by computing the
Rayleigh range of an ideal Gaussian beam, and then divide it by the
M^2 parameter for the beam.

Let's take an example using numbers from my own laser. I will first
pretend there are no collimating optics in the laser, which is not
true but will serve as a good example as to why diode lasers without
collimating optics are not good for free space setups. From the
laser's spec sheet, I know that the M^2 value in the ``bad'' direction
is 25 and that its waist size, which is probably half the size of the
diode in one principle direction, is 107 microns. Using the above
equation, I get a value of 56 centimeters, which means that an ideal
Gaussian beam with these specs will stay collimated over about half a
meter.

However, my real multimode beam will have a Rayleigh range that is
smaller than this value by a factor of 25, which is only about 2
centimeters. For this reason, diode laser beams almost always have
collimating optics; the beam from the diode itself is highly
divergent.

Returning to my own setup, if I resize the beam using a telescope to
have a waist radius of 2 millimeters so it almost entirely fits inside
the objective's exit pupil, the Rayleigh range of the embedded
Gaussian beam will be almost /20 meters/, which is pretty long. The
real beam, however, will have a Rayleigh range of about 780
millimeters meters due to the high M^2 value. *Practically, this means
I have about one meter of collimated laser beam* with which to work
since I have double the Rayleigh range of collimated distance, but
really I want the beam to travel less distance than this.

Fortunately I can shrink the beam path enough that this should not be
a problem, but it does serve as a very good lesson when looking for
lasers for a microscopy application.
