.. description: Parts list for the flat-field illuminator for STORM and PALM.
.. type: text

Many people have been writing to Suliana or I recently and asking for
a parts list for FIFI, the flat-field illuminator I developed for
large field-of-view localization microscopy. (`The manuscript may be
found here`_.)

I compiled a list of the primary parts and suggestions for the
optional parts that one may need to install FIFI into their own
microscope. You may find the link to this document (in the Open
Document .ods format) below.

The prices for the parts are approximate and were taken from the
respective vendor websites in January, 2017. Do not be surprised if
the prices have changed since this time and differ from those in the
spreadsheet.

If you find any problems or errors in this parts list, please do not
hesitate to contact me. It is highly recommended that you perform the
initial design of the illuminator for your setup before buying any
parts to avoid making costly mistakes.
