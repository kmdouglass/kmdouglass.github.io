.. description: I just learned how to make my own books from Wikipedia articles
.. type: text

Last night the internet failed in our apartment and is still down. Because of this, I ran into the
office today (a Saturday) to download a bunch of files to do some much-needed background reading on
some topics.

This lead me to an interesting question, one which I had not yet thought of: how can I download
Wikipedia pages in a format that makes for easy offline access?

A very quick Google search gave me a surprising answer: make your own book from Wikipedia pages!

Here's how it works. (I'll skip the actual details and `let you read it straight from Wikipedia's
help files`_. However, I will explain the process of making your own book.) After you activate the
book creater, you simply navigate to any Wikipedia page and click the button on the top of the page
that asks if you want to add the current page to your book. Do this for as many pages as you'd
like.

When you're ready to access your book, you can do it online, or export it to a number of formats
for offline viewing, such as PDF or an Open Document format. I thought that the PDF was beautufilly
rendered. It even included all reference information.

There are other options with this tool too, such as sorting your articles into chapters or naming
your book. I believe that you can share it with others as well.

Cheers to you, Wikipedia, for creating an awesome and useful feature!
