<p>
<i>In this post I will use paraxial optics to mean paraxial geometrical
optics. This is important since the paraxial approximation can also</i>
<i>apply to the wave theory of light.</i>
</p>

<p>
When learning a new theory, I often find it most useful to first
identify the problem that the theory was developed to solve. This
approach is particularly pertinent for learning paraxial optics, since
the theory is largely used as a tool to aid in the construction of
optical systems. Unfortunately, the fact that paraxial optics can help
solve problems often becomes lost on people because they never
actually build anything for the purpose of imaging. And even if a
someone never builds a camera or microscope, I think it is difficult
for them to see what paraxial optics concepts–such as principle
planes and aperture stops–can do for helping them troubleshoot their
hardware when it is not working as expected.
</p>

<p>
So, with this in mind, I will use this part in a series of blog posts
to answer the following question: what is the problem that paraxial
optics solves?
</p>

<p>
Paraxial optics solves the imaging problem <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="paraxial-optics-2-what-problem-does-it-solve.html#fn.1">1</a></sup>. The imaging problem as
I see it is simply this: <b>given an optical system, how can one arrange
its components to form the image of an object at a desired</b> <b>position
and with a predictable size and orientation?</b> This question has been
asked by scientists, engineers, philosophers, and others since
antiquity because we place enormous value in pictures.
</p>

<p>
To better understand this problem, I am going to step through the
parts of this statement and explain what I mean by each. First, I
mention that the imaging problem involves the use of an <b>optical
system</b>. I have to admit that I use this term partly because it is
part of the jargon of the optical sciences, but I also think that the
word "system" nicely captures the essence of what I would like to
say. An optical system is a collection of components such as lenses,
mirrors, and prisms taken together with their mechanical supports and
arranged in a meaningful way to capture and channel light as it
travels from one place to another. Below is one example of an optical
system that most people know pretty well.
</p>

<div align="center">


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../eye.jpg" alt="eye.jpg"></p>
</div>

  A human eye is an optical system! From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye#/media/File:Eye_iris.jpg">
  Peter Nóvak, Wikipedia</a>.
</div>

<p>
I have already mentioned that the components of an optical system can
include things we commonly associate with optics, such as lenses and
mirrors, but really no one such component is necessary to build an
optical system so long as it captures and does something with
light. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera">the pinhole camera</a> uses nothing but a very small
hole to form images; no lens is required! Still, we usually find some
components like lenses much more frequently in optical systems than
others, and the choice of which components to use really just depends
on the specific type of imaging problem you are trying to solve.
</p>

<p>
Next in the statement of the imaging problem I say that we will be
forming an image by arranging the components of our optical system in
a clever way. Though the intuitive notion of an image is quite clear,
I think it is actually extremely difficult to formally define it. For
the purpose of this tutorial, I think it is best at this point to rely
on the intuitive idea of an image until I have developed enough
concepts to define it in terms of optical theory <sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="paraxial-optics-2-what-problem-does-it-solve.html#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the imaging problem involves determining the location, size,
and orientation of an image formed by the system. This means that
rearrangement of our system's components is going to change these
features of the image. Things such as the size of a CCD chip or the
weight of a lens are going to place constraints on the values these
properties can take.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Perfect imaging systems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
At this point I should stress that paraxial optics is not the only
theoretical tool for solving the imaging problem. We clearly can use
non-paraxial geometrical optics or wave optics to determine the
properties of an image formed by an optical system. However, what is
interesting is that paraxial optics is one of very few theoretical
frameworks in which a perfect image can be realized <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="paraxial-optics-2-what-problem-does-it-solve.html#fn.3">3</a></sup>.
</p>

<div align="center">


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../im_perfectOpticalSystems.png" alt="im_perfectOpticalSystems.png"></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>
The above figure, which is called a <a href="http://www.edmundoptics.com/TechSupport/resource_center/downloads/Anchor-Optics/GraphicalRayTracing.pdf">ray-trace diagram</a>, illustrates
what I mean by a perfect imaging system. The system is represented as
a "black box" that collects light coming from a two-dimensional plane
(known as the object plane) and relays the light to another plane
known as the image plane. The whole system is considered to be
rotationally symmetric about a line called the optics axis so that I
can represent it as a two-dimensional sketch instead of requiring a
full, three-dimensional model. Finally, light is modeled as lines with
arrows denoting the direction of propagation <sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="paraxial-optics-2-what-problem-does-it-solve.html#fn.4">4</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Now comes the important point. Within the framework of paraxial optics
theory, it is possible to show that, given an object plane and an
image plane, one can construct an optical system consisting of
components that redirect the light rays in such a way that all the
rays leaving a point in the object plane are brought back together at
a corresponding point in the image plane. <b>This means that the perfect
optical system performs a one-to-one mapping of points in the object</b>
<b>plane to points in the image plane</b>. What's more, the distance
between every point in the image plane and the optics axis is
proportional to the distance between their corresponding points and
the axis in the object plane by a constant factor. This factor is
known as the <b>magnification</b> of the system.
</p>

<p>
The way this perfect imaging system is realized within the context of
the theory is in the way the components redirect the rays coming from
the object <sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="paraxial-optics-2-what-problem-does-it-solve.html#fn.5">5</a></sup>. What differentiates <i>paraxial</i> geometrical optics from
plain old geometrical optics is the rules dictating how the
redirection occurs.
</p>

<p>
One other important point is to consider what happens in imperfect
imaging systems. Once we violate the assumptions of paraxial optics so
that we no longer have a system operating within its range of
validity, we cannot perform a true, one-to-one mapping of points from
the object plane to the image plane. Instead, we find that rays coming
from a single point in the object plane cannot all be brought back
together in any image plane <sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="paraxial-optics-2-what-problem-does-it-solve.html#fn.6">6</a></sup>. We could say that the image plane is
a concept that does not exist outside paraxial optics. And if the
image plane does not exist, how are we to strictly define an image
size and location?
</p>

<p>
Of course, we can find planes in non-paraxial systems in which there
are pretty good images, and these usually correspond to the image
planes we find by applying the equations and simplifications of
paraxial optics. So paraxial optics is often our first tool for
modeling an imaging system. It tells us roughly where our images will
be formed and how big they are, but it will not tell us about image
quality.

<p>
With this tutorial I hope to have provided you with a conceptual basis
for understanding paraxial geometrical optics without including too
many of its details. I think a conceptual basis such as this is much
better than diving right into ray-trace diagrams with lenses and
mirros. I think new students to optics often wonder what the
importance is of paraxial optics and why it is needed when more
complete optical descriptions exist. I hope that the discussion of the
perfect imaging system and its existence only within the framework of
paraxial geometrical optics helped to clarify its importance.

    <p>
The fluorescence microscopy setup in my lab requires quite a bit of
power. The minimum irradiance requirement is greater than 1 kW per
square centimeter, and this must cover an area spanning a few tens of
microns across after focusing through the objective. When I was
designing the setup, the highest priority was placed on finding a
cheap laser with as much power as possible at a wavelength of 647 nm;
I considered all other qualities of the laser of secondary importance.
</p>

<p>
Just like everything else in science, I have learned a very good
lesson from this experience. The laser I decided to purchase is a <a href="http://www.omicron-laser.de/english/lasers/diode-lasers/brixx-lasers/brixx-diode-lasers.html">800
mW BrixX laser from Omicron</a>. The cost is under $10,000, which I
consider to be a pretty good deal for the amount of power it puts
out. There is no fiber-coupled version, but all of our lasers are free
space anyway so I did not consider this to be a big problem. The beam
is astigmatic, which is to be expected from a high power laser diode.
</p>

<p>
The astigmatism is not necessarily a big problem for me, though. What
is surprising to me is how difficult it is to keep the beam <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collimated_light">collimated</a>
over large distances, that is, to keep it roughly the same size as it
propagates. My application requires a fairly small beam size since the
exit pupil of the objective is only 6 millimeters in diameter. With
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_squared">M-squared</a> values direct from the laser of 12 and 25, it is quite
difficult to keep the beam collimated for a long enough distance to
steer the beam through all the optics and to keep it small enough to
prevent overfilling the objective's exit pupil and losing power.
</p>

<p>
What I have learned from this is that free-space diode lasers, and
more generally multimode laser beams, require extra consideration to
ensure that they will stay collimated in long setups.
</p>

<p>
So, how can I predict the distance over which my beam can stay
collimated to better judge how well it will work for my setup? The
first thing to realize is that no beam can stay collimated
forever. Real laser beams experience diffraction, which causes them to
spread as they propagate. This means that the first thing I should do
is to consider the distances spanned by the beam paths. In a
microscopy setup, this path will probably not be longer than a couple
meters. In mine, it's roughly two meters since I am combining a number
of laser beams together and need the extra space.
</p>

<p>
Once I identify the length scale over which the beam should stay
collimated, I need to examine the beam parameter that is best
associated with collimation. For a pure Gaussian beam, this parameter
is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_length">Rayleigh range</a>. The Rayleigh range is the distance between the
beam waist and the point where the cross-sectional area of the beam
has doubled, or, equivalently, to the point where the radius of the
beam has increased over the waist radius by a factor of the
\(\sqrt{2}\). For a pure Gaussian beam with a waist radius of \(w_0\) and
a wavelength of \(\lambda\), the Rayleigh range is given by the equation
</p>


\begin{equation*}
z_R = \frac{\pi w_0^2}{\lambda}
\end{equation*}

<p>
It is represented by the symbol <i>z<sub>R</sub></i> in the figure below from
Wikipedia. The total distance over which the beam will stay collimated
is represented by <i>b</i> and is just twice the Rayleigh range.
</p>

<div align="center">


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../GaussianBeamWaist.png" alt="GaussianBeamWaist.png"></p>
</div>

</div>

<p>
The Rayleigh range of a Gaussian laser beam should therefore be larger
than the characteristic distance of my setup that I identified in the
previous step. But what about multimode beams like the one from my
laser diode? This is where the concept of an "embedded Gaussian" comes
into play. (For more information about this idea, see <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.177.3400&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">this tutorial by
Tony Siegman</a>.) I can predict the collimated distance by computing the
Rayleigh range of an ideal Gaussian beam, and then divide it by the
M<sup>2</sup> parameter for the beam.
</p>

<p>
Let's take an example using numbers from my own laser. I will first
pretend there are no collimating optics in the laser, which is not
true but will serve as a good example as to why diode lasers without
collimating optics are not good for free space setups. From the
laser's spec sheet, I know that the M<sup>2</sup> value in the ``bad'' direction
is 25 and that its waist size, which is probably half the size of the
diode in one principle direction, is 107 microns. Using the above
equation, I get a value of 56 centimeters, which means that an ideal
Gaussian beam with these specs will stay collimated over about half a
meter.
</p>

<p>
However, my real multimode beam will have a Rayleigh range that is
smaller than this value by a factor of 25, which is only about 2
centimeters. For this reason, diode laser beams almost always have
collimating optics; the beam from the diode itself is highly
divergent.
</p>

<p>
Returning to my own setup, if I resize the beam using a telescope to
have a waist radius of 2 millimeters so it almost entirely fits inside
the objective's exit pupil, the Rayleigh range of the embedded
Gaussian beam will be almost <i>20 meters</i>, which is pretty long. The
real beam, however, will have a Rayleigh range of about 780
millimeters meters due to the high M<sup>2</sup> value. <b>Practically, this means
I have about one meter of collimated laser beam</b> with which to work
since I have double the Rayleigh range of collimated distance, but
really I want the beam to travel less distance than this.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately I can shrink the beam path enough that this should not be
a problem, but it does serve as a very good lesson when looking for
lasers for a microscopy application.

As a microscopist who designs and builds custom microscopes, I often
find that first order ray tracing is one of the most useful tools I
have. It is most useful to me when I am starting a design or for
checking that I have not made any serious logical blunders when
working at the bench. I also find it to be a good teaching tool and
excellent for communicating my designs to others.
</p>

<p>
Since I have recently made a lot of back-of-the-envelope ray trace
designs for a microscope I am building at work, I have begun to
critically think about why ray tracing works so well and how it fits
inside the structure of the physical theories of optics.
</p>

<p>
Ray tracing is a technique derived from <b>paraxial geometrical optics</b>
and really is just a consequence of the axioms and assumptions in the
development of the theory. When I think back to when I first learned
about paraxial optics, however, I am reminded of severe assumptions
that place limits on the scope of its validity. So how can a theory
that makes such an enormous simplification by treating the
electromagnetic waves described by Maxwell's equations as lines
obeying the rules of geometry still be so useful?
</p>

<p>
In this next series of blog posts, I want to explore this question and
take the time to relearn paraxial optics with the benefit of
hindsight. Physicists typically learn paraxial optics as their first
theory of optics because it is relatively easy as compared to
electromagnetism and quantum optics. I am curious what aspects of the
theory I can appreciate now that I am familiar with the more advanced
optical theories.
</p>

<p>
The picture below might also provide a bit of motivation for why this
interests me: we physicists learn about optics theories in a direction
of increasing complexity during our education. However, this approach
also means that we learn the most general theories last, so it is not
obvious why assumptions and approximations are made in the theories we
learn first. The result, I think, leads to a bit of logical
discordance in our minds that can prevent a clear understanding of the
subject. With this series of posts I hope to remove this cognitive
dissonance and improve my understanding of the field I work in.

<a href="https://gist.github.com/kmdouglass/507717d339bc82f850ce">I just created a Python Gist</a> for reading select lines from a text file
into memory. I came up with this Gist when I needed to parse the core
log from our <a href="https://www.micro-manager.org/">microscope control software (Micro-Manager)</a>. One of our
devices was continously sending its statistics to the computer, which
would then be recorded to the log. I wanted to find only lines that
contained the statistics by searching for the <b>STATS</b> identifier,
which was unique to these lines.
</p>

<p>
The problem was a bit more difficult than reading just the lines
containing this string because I wanted the statistics only for times
when the software was acquiring a time series of images. Luckily, the
core log also contains lines with unique strings indicating when a
time series was initiated and stopped. All lines in the log are
time-stamped.
</p>

<p>
Below is the Gist I used to solve this problem. The lines that will be
retained in memory will contain the strings in the list lineFilters. I
then define a function named stringIsIn that will return a list of
bool indicating whether each string is present in the line.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the Gist, I use a list comprehension to loop over
each line in the file. The line is appended to a growing list called
outputLines if the line contains <i>any</i> of the strings I defined. Note
that it's not necessary to use a separate definition for stringIsIn;
the list comprehension over lineFilters could have been placed inline
with the primary list comprension over lines in the file. I do think
it is more readable the way it is presented below, however.
</p>

<p>
I welcome any comments or suggestions, especially on the <a href="https://gist.github.com/kmdouglass/507717d339bc82f850ce">Gist website</a>
where others may be more likely to find it.

I use Python 3.4 in most of my data analyses and in some
simulations. I like a lot of its features, like its implementation of
generators, maps, and filters. However, much of the software on my
Debian Wheezy system depends on Python 2.7 to run, such as
<a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>. (It used to run just fine with Python 3.4, until I ran an
automatic update and that was the end of that.)
</p>

<p>
To run some Python 2.7 programs, I used to do the following:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo rm /usr/bin/python 
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python
</pre></div>

<p>
I know. Ouch. Every single time I needed to run a program that
depended on python2.7, I would delete the symlink in /usr/bin, make a
new link to python2.7, and then run my program. When I needed to give
various programs convenient access to python3.4, I would delete the
symlink and create a new one to the newer version.
</p>

<p>
This was dumb, because there is a convenient Python-based tool that
can fix the problem of needing multiple versions of Python (and
libraries!) on the same system. The solution to this problem is called
<a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of descriptions about what virtualenv is on the
internet, so I won't bother going into details here. Instead, I will
focus on just the very basics of its setup and use so that I can have
a handy future reference for when I forget how something works and so
that others can profit from what I have learned. Most everything I've
done came from <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/">python-guide.org</a>, so I'm more-or-less putting <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">what they
have already said</a> into my own words.
</p>

<p>
To start, I already have Python 2.7 and 3.4 installed on my system. In
principle, you do not need them installed at the system level, but I
already have done this so I will start from there. I first installed
pip for Python 2.7 since I only had pip3 on my system to start. I did
this because I want to keep Python 2.7 as my system's default Python
environment.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-pip
</pre></div>

<p>
Once installed, I used it to install virtualenv and
<a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">virtualenvwrapper</a>. The latter provides some nice features for working
with virtualenv.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo pip install virtualenv
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
</pre></div>

<p>
Now, virtualenvwrapper requires an environment variable to tell it
where to store the folders for each virtual environment. This
environment variable is called WORKON_HOME. First, I created the
folder it will point to:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mkdir ~/Envs
</pre></div>

<p>
Next, I edited my ~/.bashrc and added the following line:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">WORKON_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>~/Envs
</pre></div>

<p>
All of my virtual environment files (except for the Python
intepreters) will be stored in this folder. Finally, I restarted my
terminal window so that the environment variable was assigned. You can
check this by typing <code>echo $WORKON_HOME</code> in your new terminal
window. If it returns the path to your new environments folder, then
you should be fine.
</p>

<p>
Next, I ran the virtualwrapper setup script. Note that I did not need
sudo (in fact, sudo could not find a command called ``source'') and
that no output is returned when the script is run.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">source</span> /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
</pre></div>

<p>
Now virtualenvwrapper should be installed, so let's make a virtual
environment. We can do this using the <code>mkvirtualenv</code> command, followed
by a name for the environment. I will use the name ``venv'' in this
example, like Kenneth Reitz did in his guide that I linked above.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mkvirtualenv venv
</pre></div>

<p>
To start the new virtual environment, type <code>workon venv</code> and note that
change in the prompt, indicating which environment you are in. You now
have a fresh Python environment to which you can add any library you
wish. To leave the environment, type <code>deactivate</code> into your terminal.
</p>

<p>
One simple test that you can do to see whether your Python environment
really is clean is to run the Python interpreter from inside your
environment and try importing a module that you know is in your
system-wide site packages but not in your virtual environment. For
example, inside venv I type <code>python</code> at the terminal prompt and tried
importing numpy, which I had not yet installed in venv:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>import numpy
</pre></div>

<p>
This returned an <b>ImportError: No module named numpy</b>. Since I do have
numpy installed on my system but not in this environment, it tells me
that the environment is likely clean.
</p>

<p>
To install new libraries, simply use pip or install them to the folder
that was created for this environment in ~/Env. To delete a virtual
environment entirely, use <code>rmvirtual env</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now, how can I specify that I want the virtual environment to use the
python3.4 interpreter in a virtual environment named
``python3-general''? Doing so would solve my original problem. Simply
make a new virtual environment like so:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.4 python3-general
</pre></div>

<p>
Voilà. C'est tout. I hope this helps you get up and running with this
great tool!
