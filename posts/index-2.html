<a href="https://gist.github.com/kmdouglass/507717d339bc82f850ce">I just created a Python Gist</a> for reading select lines from a text file
into memory. I came up with this Gist when I needed to parse the core
log from our <a href="https://www.micro-manager.org/">microscope control software (Micro-Manager)</a>. One of our
devices was continously sending its statistics to the computer, which
would then be recorded to the log. I wanted to find only lines that
contained the statistics by searching for the <b>STATS</b> identifier,
which was unique to these lines.
</p>

<p>
The problem was a bit more difficult than reading just the lines
containing this string because I wanted the statistics only for times
when the software was acquiring a time series of images. Luckily, the
core log also contains lines with unique strings indicating when a
time series was initiated and stopped. All lines in the log are
time-stamped.
</p>

<p>
Below is the Gist I used to solve this problem. The lines that will be
retained in memory will contain the strings in the list lineFilters. I
then define a function named stringIsIn that will return a list of
bool indicating whether each string is present in the line.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the Gist, I use a list comprehension to loop over
each line in the file. The line is appended to a growing list called
outputLines if the line contains <i>any</i> of the strings I defined. Note
that it's not necessary to use a separate definition for stringIsIn;
the list comprehension over lineFilters could have been placed inline
with the primary list comprension over lines in the file. I do think
it is more readable the way it is presented below, however.
</p>

<p>
I welcome any comments or suggestions, especially on the <a href="https://gist.github.com/kmdouglass/507717d339bc82f850ce">Gist website</a>
where others may be more likely to find it.

    <p>
I use Python 3.4 in most of my data analyses and in some
simulations. I like a lot of its features, like its implementation of
generators, maps, and filters. However, much of the software on my
Debian Wheezy system depends on Python 2.7 to run, such as
<a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>. (It used to run just fine with Python 3.4, until I ran an
automatic update and that was the end of that.)
</p>

<p>
To run some Python 2.7 programs, I used to do the following:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo rm /usr/bin/python 
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python
</pre></div>

<p>
I know. Ouch. Every single time I needed to run a program that
depended on python2.7, I would delete the symlink in /usr/bin, make a
new link to python2.7, and then run my program. When I needed to give
various programs convenient access to python3.4, I would delete the
symlink and create a new one to the newer version.
</p>

<p>
This was dumb, because there is a convenient Python-based tool that
can fix the problem of needing multiple versions of Python (and
libraries!) on the same system. The solution to this problem is called
<a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of descriptions about what virtualenv is on the
internet, so I won't bother going into details here. Instead, I will
focus on just the very basics of its setup and use so that I can have
a handy future reference for when I forget how something works and so
that others can profit from what I have learned. Most everything I've
done came from <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/">python-guide.org</a>, so I'm more-or-less putting <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">what they
have already said</a> into my own words.
</p>

<p>
To start, I already have Python 2.7 and 3.4 installed on my system. In
principle, you do not need them installed at the system level, but I
already have done this so I will start from there. I first installed
pip for Python 2.7 since I only had pip3 on my system to start. I did
this because I want to keep Python 2.7 as my system's default Python
environment.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-pip
</pre></div>

<p>
Once installed, I used it to install virtualenv and
<a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">virtualenvwrapper</a>. The latter provides some nice features for working
with virtualenv.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo pip install virtualenv
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
</pre></div>

<p>
Now, virtualenvwrapper requires an environment variable to tell it
where to store the folders for each virtual environment. This
environment variable is called WORKON_HOME. First, I created the
folder it will point to:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir ~/Envs
</pre></div>

<p>
Next, I edited my ~/.bashrc and added the following line:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">WORKON_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>~/Envs
</pre></div>

<p>
All of my virtual environment files (except for the Python
intepreters) will be stored in this folder. Finally, I restarted my
terminal window so that the environment variable was assigned. You can
check this by typing <code>echo $WORKON_HOME</code> in your new terminal
window. If it returns the path to your new environments folder, then
you should be fine.
</p>

<p>
Next, I ran the virtualwrapper setup script. Note that I did not need
sudo (in fact, sudo could not find a command called ``source'') and
that no output is returned when the script is run.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">source</span> /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
</pre></div>

<p>
Now virtualenvwrapper should be installed, so let's make a virtual
environment. We can do this using the <code>mkvirtualenv</code> command, followed
by a name for the environment. I will use the name ``venv'' in this
example, like Kenneth Reitz did in his guide that I linked above.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>mkvirtualenv venv
</pre></div>

<p>
To start the new virtual environment, type <code>workon venv</code> and note that
change in the prompt, indicating which environment you are in. You now
have a fresh Python environment to which you can add any library you
wish. To leave the environment, type <code>deactivate</code> into your terminal.
</p>

<p>
One simple test that you can do to see whether your Python environment
really is clean is to run the Python interpreter from inside your
environment and try importing a module that you know is in your
system-wide site packages but not in your virtual environment. For
example, inside venv I type <code>python</code> at the terminal prompt and tried
importing numpy, which I had not yet installed in venv:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>import numpy
</pre></div>

<p>
This returned an <b>ImportError: No module named numpy</b>. Since I do have
numpy installed on my system but not in this environment, it tells me
that the environment is likely clean.
</p>

<p>
To install new libraries, simply use pip or install them to the folder
that was created for this environment in ~/Env. To delete a virtual
environment entirely, use <code>rmvirtual env</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now, how can I specify that I want the virtual environment to use the
python3.4 interpreter in a virtual environment named
``python3-general''? Doing so would solve my original problem. Simply
make a new virtual environment like so:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.4 python3-general
</pre></div>

<p>
Voilà. C'est tout. I hope this helps you get up and running with this
great tool!
