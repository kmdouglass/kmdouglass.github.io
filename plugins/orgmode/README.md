This plugin implements an Emacs Org-mode based compiler for Nikola.

## Setup

If your emacs does not ship with org-mode (>=8.x), you will have to edit the
`init.el` file supplied with this plugin, and load a newer version of org-mode.

You will also need to add the orgmode compiler to your list of compilers, and
modify your POSTS & PAGES variables.  (See the sample conf file provided.)

## Customization

You can add any customization variables that you wish to add, to modify the
output generated by org-mode to `conf.el` inside the plugin directory.  This
lets you have custom configuration, that doesn't get wiped out each time the
plugin is updated.
