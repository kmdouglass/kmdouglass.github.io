Born and raised in the American Midwestern state of Ohio, I am now a
post-doc in the <a href="http://leb.epfl.ch">Laboratory for Experimental Biophysics</a> at <a href="http://www.epfl.ch">EPFL</a> in
Lausanne, Switzerland. My work is in method development for
super-resolution fluorescence microscopies and their application to
the study of cellular systems. This involves utilizing my expertise
in a diverse range of topics, including optical design, statistical
modeling, and computer programming. The goal is to image single
molecules inside cells with resolution on the order of nanometers so
we can better understand their structure and function. In
particular, I have designed microscopes and/or analysis pipelines
for imaging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin">chromatin</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrosome">centrosome</a>.

My education began at <a href="http://www.edon.k12.oh.us/">Edon Northwest Schools</a> in the small
agricultural town of Edon, Ohio. I attended college at <a href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/">Rose-Hulman
Institute of Technology</a>, obtaining the B.S. degree in Engineering
Physics in 2007. In 2011, I obtained the M.S. in Optics from <a href="http://www.creol.ucf.edu/">CREOL</a>
and the PhD in Optics in 2013.

I have been fortunate enough to work on research projects in a
number of very interesting fields. In my doctoral thesis, I worked
with Prof. Aristide Dogariu and studied the effects of
electromagnetic radiation propagation through disordered systems,
such as colloids, photonic crystals, and biological tissue. This
led, for example, to a new understanding of how to <a href="http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v6/n12/abs/nphoton.2012.278.html">control colloidal
particles</a> using multiple light scattering and a new <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/ra/c4ra11627e#!divAbstract">fiber
optic-based sensor</a> for investigating microscopic strucutral
relaxation times in complex fluids.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 2006, I worked with Prof. Margaret Murnane and
Prof. Henry Kapteyn as an undergraduate researcher at the University
of Colorado, Boulder developing an optical spectrometer for
Ti:Sapphire beam characterization in a vacuum chamber. While at
Rose-Hulman, I developed the software interface to photon counters
and developed a microfluidic platform for transporting oocytes on a
chip in the semiconductor device fabrication clean room.

I love rock climbing, hiking, bicycling, and the great outdoors. I
also love to travel and learn about different cultures. Most of my
free time is spent learning French, learning about computer
programming, and with my beautiful wife Kirsten, for whom I am
incredibly lucky to have in my life.
