I've been working on realigning one of our STORM microscopy setups
and moving the other over the past couple weeks. As a result, I've
been doing a lot more alignment lately than I normally do, which has
got me thinking about alignment in general.
</p>

<p>
I've worked in optics labs for nearly ten years now, but I was never
systematically taught how to do alignments. Eventually, I just
figured it out from asking and watching lots of others do it. This
part of experimental optics seems to be something that's passed down
and shared across generations of PhD students and post-docs, like
some sort of cultural heritage preserved by spoken word.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this fact means that written tutorials or alternative
resources on alignment are scarce. This in turn leads to frustration
for new students who can't easily find someone to show them how to
align a system. I was lucky in my training because both my
undergraduate and graduate programs were in centers dedicated to the
study of optics and optical engineering. Resources were
plentiful. But for a biologist working with a custom microscope
using multiple laser lines, finding someone who is competent in
optics to help realign their system can be highly unlikely.
</p>

<p>
So how can people who don't have a background in optics be trained
in alignment? I'm certain that written tutorials are <i>not</i> the best
tool, since aligning an optics setup is a very hands-on job. But, a
tutorial that makes explicit the principles of alignment might make
a good starting point for others.
</p>

<p>
What are these principles? Below is my rough, initial list that
applies to aligning laser beams. Aligning incoherent systems is
another beast altogether.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The angle of the beam propagation is just as important as the
position of the beam in a plane perpendicular to the table. In
other words, just because a beam is going through a stopped-down
iris doesn't mean it's traveling where you think it is.
</li>
<li>You need to measure the beam position in two planes to determine
its angle of propagation.
</li>
<li>Use "layers of abstraction" to divide sections of the setup into
independent units.
</li>
<li>Use paired mirrors to get enough degrees of freedom to establish
these abstraction layers.
</li>
<li>Design feedback mechanisms into the system. In other words, keep
some irises or alignment marks on the walls in place to aid in
future realignments.
</li>
</ol>
