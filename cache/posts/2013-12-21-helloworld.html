<p>
Well, I've finally got this site off the ground&#x2026; more or less.
</p>

<p>
This website is the continuation of my blog, <a href="http://quadrule.blogspot.com">My Quad-Ruled Life</a>. On
that site, I explored a number of topics as a graduate student in
optics, while improving my writing as well. As the site progressed
and I matured academically, I found that I was blogging less often,
but still used the blog as a means of exploring ideas. Additionally,
I desired a place to present notes and code to the public in an
easily accessible and open manner.
</p>

<p>
So, after discovering <a href="http://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> and <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, I quickly hashed
together a fully homemade site that allowed me to keep writing blog
posts and to present some of the fruits of my research freely on the
internet.
</p>

<p>
I hope you'll find this site useful as a learning resource and as a
means to get to know me better as a scientist.
