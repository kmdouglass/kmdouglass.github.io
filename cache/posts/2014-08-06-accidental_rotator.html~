Recently in the lab we made a seemingly minor change to one of our
microscopes that led to a minor problem that lasted for about a
week. Briefly, we introduced a mirror following a periscope that
raises the plane that the laser beams travel in parallel to the
table. The periscope is necessary to bringthe beams out of the plane
containing the beam-combining optics and into the TIRF module port
on our Zeiss inverted microscope for epi-illumination.
</p>

<p>
We had introduced the mirror to give us one more degree of freedom
for steering the beam, but to do so we had to move the periscope and
turn one of the mirrors by 90 degrees. Unfortunately, after doing
this we found that the optical power leaving the microscope
objective had dropped by a factor of 10, which was insufficient to
do STORM imaging.
</p>

<p>
We eventually determined that the Zeiss TIRF module contained a
polarizing beam splitter that combined the laser beams with white
light from another port at 90 degrees to the beam path. In the
newsetup, we placed a broadband halfwave plate before the TIRF
module, rotated it while watching a power meter, and were finally
able to get even more power leaving the objective than with the old
setup.
</p>

<p>
So what had happened to cause the decrease in power by adding
another mirror, and why did introducing the halfwave plate fix the
problem? As it turns out, you can rotate the polarization by 90
degrees using only a pair of mirrors to redirect the beam into a
plane parallel to its original plane of travel but into a direction
perpendicular to its original one. This was what we were doing
before we introduced the mirror. After the new mirror was put in
place, we rotated a mirror of the periscope, which effectively
rotated the laser beam's polarization back into its original
orientation. And, since there was a polarizing beam splitter inside
the TIRF module, the new beam polarization was transmitted through
the module instead of being reflected towards the objective.

The picture below describes how this can happen. Note that the final
beam trajectory is in the direction pointing <i>into</i> the screen.
