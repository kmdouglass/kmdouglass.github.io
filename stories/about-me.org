* Biosketch
  I am a research scientist in optical sensing for soft matter
  characterization and cell biology with over ten years of optics
  laboratory experience. My strategy is to merge optical technologies
  and custom software into sensing systems that are designed to
  address specific problems. To do this, I work directly with
  biologists and chemists to identify the shortcomings in their
  measurement tools and design the solutions that effectively meet
  their needs. I benefit greatly from my multidisciplinary background,
  which has included topics such as fundamental optics, information
  theory and signal processing, software design, and materials
  science.

  For my current project I am developing high throughput methods in
  single molecule fluorescence microscopy by combining smart optical
  design, new camera technologies, and efficient algorithms from
  machine learning and bioinformatics. Recently I achieved the first
  milestone of this work: the construction of a high-throughput,
  super-resolution fluorescence microscope that I designed and built
  myself. The next step will see the application of this microscope
  towards the resolution of three problems in cell biology that
  require extremely large datasets and automation to solve: contextual
  effects in the structure of eukaryotic chromatin, mapping protein
  distributions inside human centrioles, and establishing the genetic
  regulatory network behind bacterial cell shape determination.
