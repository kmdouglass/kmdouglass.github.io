  I am a research scientist in optical sensing for soft matter and
  cell biology with over ten years of optics laboratory experience. My
  work involves the combination of optics and custom software into
  sensing systems that are designed to address specific questions
  about the microscopic structure of soft matter, i.e. proteins, DNA,
  synthetic polymers, and similar macromolecules. To do this, I work
  directly with biologists and chemists to identify the shortcomings
  in their measurement tools and design the solutions that effectively
  meet their needs. In my work, I benefit greatly from my
  multidisciplinary background, which has included topics such as
  optics and photonics, information theory and signal processing,
  software design, and materials science.
