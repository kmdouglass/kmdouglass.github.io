<span class="section-number-2">3</span> Optics Setup</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The optics for the pgFocus were constrained by the following
factors:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It had to integrate into an existing microscopy setup using
several external free space lasers for epi-illumination. Two
mirrors steer the beam into the microscope's epi-illumination
port, and the one closest to the lasers acts as a very narrow
entrance pupil.
</li>
<li>It has to pass the IR beam through the epi-illumination
port. There are too many filters in the imaging pathway to get
the IR beam through to the objective and back.
</li>
<li>The IR beam has to be totally internally reflected from the
coverslip. The direct reflection of the beam has too many
interference fringes and is not sensitive to very small
displacements of the objective.
</li>
<li>As much power as possible from the excitation lasers must be
maintained, which means a minimum of optics must be introduced
into their beam path.
</li>

<h3 id="sec-3-1">
<span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Layout on optical bench</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Below I've included a sketch of the setup. This setup is quite
different than the OLD one mentioned below. I had to abandon the
design consisting of a self-contained setup on a small breadboard
because of the complexities of integrating the optics into an
existing microscopy setup.
</p>

<p>
In the old setup, the mirrors used in the periscope that directed
the laser beams for fluorescence excitation presented the infrared
beam with an entrance pupil that was too small. The IR beam could
not be brought into TIR mode. This is important because the direct
reflection from the coverslip contains too many interference
fringes for the pgFocus to lock onto.
</p>

<p>
In the current setup, I only needed to introduce a shortpass filter
into the beam path for the fluorescence excitation lasers. The
infrared laser used by the pgFocus passed through an iris and beam
splitter, then was reflected by this shortpass filter into the
microscope.
</p>

<p>
The return beam exited the microscope through the same port,
reflected off the shortpass filter, then was reflected by the
beamsplitter onto the linear sensor array.

<h3 id="sec-3-2">
<span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Alignment of the infrared beam</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
The alignment of the IR beam in the objective's back focal plane is
critical to achieving a strong reflection from the coverslip and
for being sensitive to objective displacements.
</p>

<p>
Due to the presence of an epi-illumination lens in our microscope,
I did not worry about placing any lenses in front of the IR
beam. The IR beam was collimated at the laser output, and the
epi-illumination lens focused the beam onto the objective's back
focal plane.
</p>

<p>
To bring the beam into a totally internally reflecting mode (TIR),
the beam has to be focused to a point on the perimeter of the
objective's rear aperture. You'll see this helpful "tip"
everywhere, but there are very few resources that tell you how to
know if the beam is actually focused at one of these points. Also,
my laser was 830 nm, which meant that I needed an IR viewer card to
see it. This added another layer of difficulty to the alignment.
</p>

<p>
Here is a rough summary of the steps I follow for alignment of the
IR beam. If you have questions that require me to be more specific,
please feel free to ask. My e-mail address is
kyle.m.douglass@gmail.com.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Mount your sample. Use index-matching oil between the objective
and coverslip. Without it, you probably won't be able to make
the IR beam totally internally reflect off the coverslip/sample
interface. And since this system really only works for high NA
immersion objectives, your images will be pretty bad if you
don't use oil anyway.
</li>
<li>Get the beam roughly aligned. Use the tip-tilt stage that the
shortpass filter is mounted to and the tip-tilt controls on the
laser mount to get some (really, any) IR light through the
objective. Check this by holding the IR viewer card close above
the sample. You can also remove any filters in the imaging path
and look for the IR beam on your camera output.
</li>
<li>Once you can see the beam on the camera, use the tip-tilt stages
so the beam goes straight up and away from the objective. Check
also that the beam is centered on your camera's field of
view. If these two conditions are satisfied, your beam is
passing through the center of the objective's back aperture and
is traveling parallel to the optics axis.
</li>
<li>
<b>Warning</b> Try not to send the beam into anyone's eyes during
this step. It's probably eye safe, but better safe than
sorry. Use one of the tip-tilt adjustment screws to adjust the
beam direction so that it leaves the objective at an angle,
instead of going straight upwards.
</li>
<li>Note the direction that the beam has traveled on the
camera. It's likely gone up, down, left, or right. This part is
important, because you want to align the beam so that axial
drift of your objective causes a movement of the reflected beam
that is <b>parallel to the pgFocus linear sensor array.</b>
</li>
<li>At angles where the beam approaches the periphery of the field
of view on the camera, you should see a strong reflection in the
plane of the pgFocus sensor. This will be the TIR beam. Align
the pgFocus sensor so that it's centered on this beam. Note the
alignment of the sensor array.
</li>
<li>Bring up the intensity readout screen in the pgFocus
software. (Press the 'l' key if using the original Processing
code.) You should see a spike corresponding to the beam. Adjust
the iris to control the beam power if you're saturating the
detector, or place a neutral density filter in front of the
beam. (I was surprised at how much power I got back from the
objective from only a 1 mW laser. The pgFocus's sensor array is
very sensitive, but I don't think you can damage it with a
reasonable amount of saturation.)
</li>
<li>You can adjust the tip-tilt of the laser slightly to center the
beam on the linear pixel array, but make sure that the beam is
at the critical angle or beyond it for TIR.
</li>
<li>As a test, move the objective scanner up and down so that the
objective is translated axially. I can see lateral shifts of the
beam profile on the pgFocus intensity readout by eye that are as
small as 50 nm. If you don't see a shift, there are two possible
reasons.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Another reflection from the other optics is hitting the
linear sensor array and not the TIR beam.
</li>
<li>The TIR beam is moving perpendicular to the pgFocus array
with axial objective displacements. You can either rotate the
pgFocus sensor array by 90 degrees or move the IR beam to
another position in the back focal plane. Looking at the
camera readout, this means the beam should be on the
left/right of the screen if it was originally at the
top/bottom, or vice versa. You will probably have to readjust
the pgFocus's sensor array position when you do this.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If all goes well, you should see a narrow, single peak that is
centered in the pgFocus intensity readout. If you change the
objective scanner's position by as little as a few tens of nm you
should be able to perceive a change in the position of this
peak. The pgFocus tends to judge better than my eye can at
objective displacements, so I believe that you can achieve focus
locking with 10 nm precision or smaller (<b>tests of this to come</b>).

<span class="section-number-3">6.1</span> Notes on the old setup</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
I learned after a bit of fiddling with the following setup that it
suffered from two limitations. One limitation, which is minor, is
that it is a bit difficult to bring the IR beam into objective TIRF
mode with the pair of tip-tilt mirrors. Originally, I had placed
the mirrors on tip-tilt mounts for beam alignment and planned to
translate one of the mirrors to move the beam into
TIRF. Unfortunately, I soon discovered a tube lens in the
microscope body (an Olympus IX71) that I did not account for. This
meant that a simple translation of the mirror did not correspond to
a simple lateral translation of the beam in the objective's back
focal plane. Instead, the beam's position <i>and</i> angle changed at
the same time.
</p>

<p>
More severe was the placement of the setup relative to the
microscope body. Due to the constraints of installing this into an
existing microscope setup, I had to place the breadboard seen below
a fair distance from the epi-illumination port of the
microscope. The mirrors that send our fluorescence excitation beams
into the microscope act as effective apertures that severly limit
the angle of the beam entering the scope body. Because of this, I
can not squeeze the beam into microscope at a steep enough angle to
bring the IR beam into TIRF.
</p>

<p>
I could get a direct reflection returned from the coverslip that
was very strong, but it contained interference fringes and was not
very sensitive to very small objective displacements.
</p>

<p>
All my notes on this design are the original, though, for reference
in the future.

The optics for the pgFocus include the following important items:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>IR laser (we used an 830 nm, 1 mW diode laser)
</li>
<li>Two lenses for focusing the laser beam
</li>
<li>Two beam steering mirrors
</li>
<li>Beam splitter
</li>
<li>Dichroic short pass filter (ours has a 750 nm cutoff wavelength).

Below is the breadboard for the optics used for the autofocus
module. I use a lens pair (two +25mm focal length lenses) to adjust
the divergence of the beam which allows me to focus the beam in the
objective's back focal plane (BFP). The mirrors are mounted to
tip-tilt stages for beam steering and the second mirror is on a
translation stage. Once the beam is centered and focused in the
BFP, I translate the stage to move the focus to the edge of the BFP
for TIRF imaging.

I have not shown the dichroic filter which is inserted into the
fluorescence excitation beam path of our existing setup. I have
also not shown the linear sensor array from the pgFocus, but I have
marked its location.

<span class="section-number-3">6.4</span> Installation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-4">
<p>
I performed the following steps when installing the autofocus
optics into our existing setup.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Attach breadboard to optical table.
</li>
<li>Insert dichroic filter into the beam path.
</li>
<li>Bring a sample of fluorescent microbeads into focus on the
camera. Try using white light first to see the beads, then use
the excitation laser to view the fluorescence.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If this doesn't work, I may need to reposition one of the
lenses in the beam expander in the existing optical
train. This is because the dichroic filter will slightly
change the path length of the excitation beam.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the image is found, turn on the IR laser and try to make
it colinear with the excitation beams. Use the dichroic mount
for alignment first and the mirrors on my custom breadboard
second.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Watch the image on the computer. The Andor iXon should be able
to see IR light at 830nm (unless there's an IR filter in front
of the chip).
</li>
<li>Align the beam so that it's centered in the FOV and focused at
the objective's back focal plane. This would be the alignment
for an epi-fluorescence setup if indeed we were using the IR
beam to excite fluorescence.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<del>Translate (using the translation stage, not the tip-tilt adjustments!) the mirror on the custom breadboard to move the IR focus to the edge of the back focal plane. This should put the beam into TIRF mode. Note that I need to swap the high NA objective on the microscope first.</del>
</li>
<li>I discovered that there's a tube lens in our beam path somewhere
before the objective and after the epi-illumination input port
on our Olympus IX71. This probably focuses a collimated laser
beam onto the objective's BFP. Use the tip-tilt mirrors on the
autofocus breadboard and not the translation stage to center the
beam. The reflected beam from the coverslip is strong enough to
work for an air/coverslip interface.
</li>
</ol>
