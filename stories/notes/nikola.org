* First steps

** Initialize the site
   Type the following at the command line to initialize a new Nikola
   site:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
nikola init site_name
   #+END_SRC

   Answer the questions to setup the initial site. Be sure the base
   URL ends in '/'.

-----

** Install and configure the org-mode plugin
   Nikola can compile org-mode files using a custom
   plugin. Information on the plugin can be found here:
   http://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode. To install the plugin for my
   site, I ran the following command from inside my site directory:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
nikola plugin -i orgmode
   #+END_SRC

   This created a folder called /plugins/ inside the site directory
   containing the orgmode plugin files. The most important file is
   init.el.

   Next, I had to add the org-mode compiler to the COMPILERS
   dictionary in conf.py:

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
COMPILERS["orgmode"] = ('.org',)
   #+END_SRC
   
   Note that I manually edited the COMPILERS dictionary to add the
   key-value pair; I did not actually add to the dictionary with the
   code above. 
   
   I also had to modify my POSTS and PAGES variables in
   conf.py to read .org files:

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
POSTS = POSTS + (("posts/*.org", "posts", "post.tmpl"),)
PAGES = PAGES + (("stories/*.org", "posts", "post.tmpl"),)
   #+END_SRC

   To create a post using org-mode, I need to enter the following code
   at the top of the org-file in a comments section:
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
.. title:
.. slug: 
.. date: 
.. tags: 
.. link:
.. description:
.. type: text
#+END_COMMENT
   #+END_SRC

** Setting the github_deploy variables

   When publishing a project website on GitHub, you push the website
   files to a branch called *gh-pages*. However, when publishing a
   GitHub user page, the files are pushed to the *master* branch.

   By default, Nikola is configured to push to gh-pages. For my
   personal website, I need to change the deploy branch to master. I
   can do this in the conf.py file by uncommenting and modifying the
   line for the =GITHUB_DEPLOY_BRANCH= variable:

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
GITHUB_DEPLOY_BRANCH = 'master'
   #+END_SRC

-----

* Customization

** Set the theme to bootstrap3 with a color scheme from bootswatch
   First, install the bootstrap3 theme from the themes repository. In
   the end, I don't think this part is necessary.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
nikola install_theme bootstrap3
   #+END_SRC

   Next, change the color scheme to darkly from bootswatch.com.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
nikola bootswatch_theme -n custom_theme -s darkly -p bootstrap3
   #+END_SRC
   
   Finally, change the theme variable to =custom_theme= inside
   conf.py.
   
-----

** Navigation links
   You can edit what navigation links appear by changing the
   NAVIGATION LINKS variable in conf.py. See this section of the
   handbook: http://getnikola.com/handbook.html#configuration

-----

** Teasers
   To only include portions of posts on the index page, you have to
   set the =INDEX_TEASERS= variable to =True=. By default, only the
   RSS feed will include teasers.
   
   I'm not currently sure how to implemement this with the orgmode
   Nikola plugin, however. I tried surrounding the reStructuredText
   =.. TEASER_END= in #+BEGIN/END_COMMENT brackets, but this did not
   work.

-----

* Errors

** Duplicated definition of render_listings
   Shortly after switching my GitHub user page from Jekyll to Nikola,
   I received the following error while running the command =nikola
   github_deploy=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
ERROR: Task generation 'render_site' has duplicated definition of 'render_listings:output/listings/index.html'
[2014-12-27T15:09:48Z] ERROR: github_deploy: Build failed, not deploying to GitHub
   #+END_SRC

   I deleted the cache and __pycache__ directories and the doit
   database files after reading around the internet, but this didn't
   fix the problem. Ultimately, I deleted the listings folder which
   fixed it, though I'm not sure how good of a fix this is, since I
   may want to use the feature enabled by listings in the future. I
   believe that this feature is easy insertion of formatted code into
   webpages.
