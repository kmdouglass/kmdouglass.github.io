* Org-mode

** LaTeX Export

*** Move table captions below tables
    This was tested with Org-mode version 8.2.6 and emacs 24.4.50.

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x customize-variable RET org-latex-table-caption-above RET nil
    #+END_SRC

* eshell

** Changing the timeout on sudo
   By default in the eshell, you have to enter your password for sudo
   everytime I sudo something. This gets a bit annoying since I often
   have to run related sudo commands.

   I found a way to change the time out at [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/5608/how-to-let-eshell-remember-sudo-password-for-two-minutes][this
   discussion]]. Essentially, I first added these lines to my /init.el/
   file.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'em-tramp) ; to load eshellâ€™s sudo
(setq eshell-prefer-lisp-functions t)
(setq eshell-prefer-lisp-variables t)
   #+END_SRC

   Then, in the eshell, I created the following alias that gets
   permanently saved to my .emacs.d/ directory:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
alias sudo 'eshell/sudo $*'
   #+END_SRC

   Finally, I added these lines to my /init.el/
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq password-cache t) ; enable password caching
(setq password-cache-expiry 5) ; for five minutes
   #+END_SRC

   After reloading emacs, I found that the password can now be cached.

* The Virtualenv package

** Installation
   To install this package, simply use emacs's package manager: =M-x
   list-packages=. The package to install is called ``virtualenv''. I
   installed version 1.2 from the Marmelade repo on 2015-02-10.

-----
** The default environments directory
   This package treats ~/.virtualenvs as the default directory. It can
   probably be changed, but it was just easier for me to install my
   virtualenvs to this directory. (Don't forget to set the environment
   variable WORKON_HOME to this directory as well).

-----

** Switch virtual environments
   Most emacs commands for this package start with
   ``virtualenv-''. For example, work on a specific environment, use
   =virtualenv-workon=. You can replace ``workon'' with ``deactivate''
   to turn off a given virtual environment.
