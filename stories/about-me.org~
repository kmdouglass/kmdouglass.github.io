* Brief Biography
  
  [[file:../images/me_for_web.jpg]]
  
  Born and raised in the American Midwestern state of Ohio, I am now a
  post-doc in the [[http://leb.epfl.ch][Laboratory for Experimental Biophysics]] at [[http://www.epfl.ch][EPFL]] in
  Lausanne, Switzerland. My work is in method development for
  super-resolution fluorescence microscopies and their application to
  the study of cellular systems. This involves utilizing my expertise
  in a diverse range of topics, including optical design, statistical
  modeling, and computer programming. The goal is to image single
  molecules inside cells with resolution on the order of nanometers so
  we can better understand their structure and function. In
  particular, I have designed microscopes and/or analysis pipelines
  for imaging [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin][chromatin]] and the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrosome][centrosome]].

  My education began at [[http://www.edon.k12.oh.us/][Edon Northwest Schools]] in the small
  agricultural town of Edon, Ohio. I attended college at [[http://www.rose-hulman.edu/][Rose-Hulman
  Institute of Technology]], obtaining the B.S. degree in Engineering
  Physics in 2007. In 2011, I obtained the M.S. in Optics from [[http://www.creol.ucf.edu/][CREOL]]
  and the PhD in Optics in 2013.

  I have been fortunate enough to work on research projects in a
  number of very interesting fields. In my doctoral thesis, I worked
  with Prof. Aristide Dogariu and studied the effects of
  electromagnetic propagation through disordered systems, such as
  colloids, photonic crystals, and biological tissue. This led, for
  example, to a new understanding of how to [[http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v6/n12/abs/nphoton.2012.278.html][control colloidal
  particles]] using multiple light scattering and a new [[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/ra/c4ra11627e#!divAbstract][fiber
  optic-based sensor]] for investigating microscopic strucutral
  relaxation times in complex fluids.

  In the summer of 2006, I worked with Prof. Margaret Murnane and
  Prof. Henry Kapteyn as an undergraduate researcher at the University
  of Colorado, Boulder developing an optical spectrometer for
  Ti:Sapphire beam characterization in a vacuum chamber. While at
  Rose-Hulman, I developed the software interface to photon counters
  and developed a microfluidic platform for transporting oocytes on a
  chip in the semiconductor device fabrication clean room.

  I love rock climbing, hiking, bicycling, and the great outdoors. I
  also love to travel and learn about different cultures. Most of my
  free time is spent learning French, learning about computer
  programming, and with my beautiful wife Kirsten, for whom I am
  incredibly lucky to have in my life.
