If you have come to this page, then you are probably interested in
learning about optics. If this is true, then you have found a very
good place. You see, I have been formally learning and working with
optics since I was 18 years old when I studied the topic in my high
school physics class. I've worked in optics labs continuously since
that time, earning a bachelor of science degree in engineering and a
PhD in optics along the way.
</p>

<p>
However, my formal training and the degrees I have earned are not
really why you have found a good place to learn. There are many people
in this world who have more credentials than I do, who have worked
more years than I have, and who generally know more than I do about
optics.
</p>

<p>
The real reason for why I think that this is a good place to learn is
because I know firsthand what makes optics a difficult topic and I
have thought <b>a lot</b> about why this is and how it can be
fixed. Largely, the theories and tools we use to understand optical
phenomena are presented as subunits of other disciplines, like
electromagnetism or microscopy. For this reason, students are rarely
encouraged to form a fully self-consistent understanding of light and
its interaction with matter. Engineers and scientists who rely on
optics technologies but who have not learned to appreciate their
subtleties are therefore putting themselves at risk of failure in
their career.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the utility that exists in learning about optics, I also think
that developing a better understanding of it can be exciting. Optics
and photonics enable so much of the technology in our modern world
that it would be a shame for someone to not understand even a little
bit about how it all works at a fundamental level.
</p>

<p>
For these reasons, I decided to create a set of tutorials that would
provide those who were interested with a different way of thinking
about the theory and application of light. In them I want to show how
optics theories can be presented as a coherent body of knowledge in
its own right and to address its common misunderstandings. My target
audience is primarily students from high school through graduate
school, but I also hope to stimulate interest in those in the general
public who are curious about science.
</p>



<p>
Let's begin this series of tutorials by considering the most obvious
question that one can ask: what exactly is ``optics and photonics?''
