* Fiji and Micro-Manager
  Using and customizing Micro-Manager takes a while to learn. Here are
  the notes I have collected along the way.

* pgFocus autofocus module
  I've tested Karl Bellve's [[http://big.umassmed.edu/wiki/index.php/PgFocus][pgFocus]] open source and open hardware
  autofocus module. This module maintains the focus of a microscope
  overtime by sending a control signal that adjusts the position of
  the microscope objective. The control signal is generated in
  response to the displacement of an infrared beam hitting a linear
  light sensor array. The beam is reflected off of the coverslip/water
  interface.
