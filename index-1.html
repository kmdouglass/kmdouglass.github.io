Recently in the lab we made a seemingly minor change to one of our
microscopes that led to a minor problem that lasted for about a
week. Briefly, we introduced a mirror following a periscope that
raises the plane that the laser beams travel in parallel to the
table. The periscope is necessary to bringthe beams out of the plane
containing the beam-combining optics and into the TIRF module port
on our Zeiss inverted microscope for epi-illumination.
</p>

<p>
We had introduced the mirror to give us one more degree of freedom
for steering the beam, but to do so we had to move the periscope and
turn one of the mirrors by 90 degrees. Unfortunately, after doing
this we found that the optical power leaving the microscope
objective had dropped by a factor of 10, which was insufficient to
do STORM imaging.
</p>

<p>
We eventually determined that the Zeiss TIRF module contained a
polarizing beam splitter that combined the laser beams with white
light from another port at 90 degrees to the beam path. In the
newsetup, we placed a broadband halfwave plate before the TIRF
module, rotated it while watching a power meter, and were finally
able to get even more power leaving the objective than with the old
setup.
</p>

<p>
So what had happened to cause the decrease in power by adding
another mirror, and why did introducing the halfwave plate fix the
problem? As it turns out, you can rotate the polarization by 90
degrees using only a pair of mirrors to redirect the beam into a
plane parallel to its original plane of travel but into a direction
perpendicular to its original one. This was what we were doing
before we introduced the mirror. After the new mirror was put in
place, we rotated a mirror of the periscope, which effectively
rotated the laser beam's polarization back into its original
orientation. And, since there was a polarizing beam splitter inside
the TIRF module, the new beam polarization was transmitted through
the module instead of being reflected towards the objective.
</p>

<p>
The picture below describes how this can happen. Note that the final
beam trajectory is in the direction pointing <i>into</i> the screen.

As a physcist, I'm a relative newcomer to the biological
sciences. As a result, many approaches to doing science within these
fields are new and really interesting to me.
</p>

<p>
One such idea is the <i>-omics</i> approach to science. Sonja Prohaska
and Peter Stadler provide an insightful and sometimes amusing
intrepetation of <i>-omics</i> studies in an article in the book
<i>Bioinformatics for Omics Data.</i> (The PubMed link to the article is
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21370084">here</a>, but you can find a pdf by Googling "The use and abuse of
-omes.") According to them, <i>-omics</i> refers to the research field of
digesting the pile of data coming from measurements of a particular
<i>-ome</i>, such as the "genome" or "transcriptome." The goal is to
relate the collection of parts within the <i>-ome</i> to biological
function, or at least to determine function by comparing <i>-omes</i> of
two different organisms.
</p>

<p>
The authors explain that <i>-omics</i> approaches have three components,
which I quote from their article:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A suite of (typically high-throughput) technologies address a
well-defined collection of biological objects, the pertinent
<i>-ome</i>.
</li>
<li>Both technologically and conceptually there is a cataloging
effort to enumerate and characterize the individual
objects–hopefully coupled with an initiative to make this
catalog available as a database.
</li>
<li>Beyond the enumeration of objects, one strives to cover the
quantitative aspects of the <i>-ome</i> at hand.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
While grand in scope, these approaches carry difficulties that to me
appear unique. As stated above, <i>-omic</i> information is acquired
through high-throughput techniques, which means that they generate
very large amounts of data. Of major concern is actually linking
this data to biological function. In other words, scientists must
answer whether the correlations in the data actually allow us to
predict the behavior of a cell or tissue. As might be expected,
generating a complex data set such as is found in <i>-omics</i> studies
can be quite impressive at first glance. But this complexity may
hide the fact that no biologically relevant conclusions can be drawn
from it.
</p>

<p>
The authors specifically enumerate four limitations that could
adversely affect <i>-omics</i> studies:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Technical limitations
</li>
<li>Limitations in the experimental design (such as heavy reliance on
assumptions)
</li>
<li>Conceptual limitations
</li>
<li>Limitations in the analysis
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Particularly, the conceptual limitations struck me as
intriguing. The authors offered the example of genomics studies in
which the notion of a "gene" is not currently a well-defined
concept. When the concepts underpinning an entire collection of
measurements is unclear, we should question whether the measured
data has the meaning that we think it does.
</p>

<p>
Overall, I found that this commentary provided an interesting and
sobering view of one particular approach to studying biology. It's
interesting because I suspect that many important biological
questions in the near future will come from taking an integrated and
systems perspective. This perspective will require high-throughput
techniques that carry the same limitations that <i>-omics</i> studies
have.

Last night the internet failed in our apartment and is still
down. Because of this, I ran into the office today (a Saturday) to
download a bunch of files to do some much-needed background reading
on some topics.
</p>

<p>
This lead me to an interesting question, one which I had not yet
thought of: how can I download Wikipedia pages in a format that
makes for easy offline access?
</p>

<p>
A very quick Google search gave me a surprising answer: make your
own book from Wikipedia pages!
</p>

<p>
Here's how it works. (I'll skip the actual details and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Books">let you read
it straight from Wikipedia's help files</a>. However, I will explain the
process of making your own book.) After you activate the book
creater, you simply navigate to any Wikipedia page and click the
button on the top of the page that asks if you want to add the
current page to your book. Do this for as many pages as you'd like.
</p>

<p>
When you're ready to access your book, you can do it online, or
export it to a number of formats for offline viewing, such as PDF or
an Open Document format. I thought that the PDF was beautufilly
rendered. It even included all reference information.
</p>

<p>
There are other options with this tool too, such as sorting your
articles into chapters or naming your book. I believe that you can
share it with others as well.
</p>

<p>
Cheers to you, Wikipedia, for creating an awesome and useful
feature!

I've been working on realigning one of our STORM microscopy setups
and moving the other over the past couple weeks. As a result, I've
been doing a lot more alignment lately than I normally do, which has
got me thinking about alignment in general.
</p>

<p>
I've worked in optics labs for nearly ten years now, but I was never
systematically taught how to do alignments. Eventually, I just
figured it out from asking and watching lots of others do it. This
part of experimental optics seems to be something that's passed down
and shared across generations of PhD students and post-docs, like
some sort of cultural heritage preserved by spoken word.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this fact means that written tutorials or alternative
resources on alignment are scarce. This in turn leads to frustration
for new students who can't easily find someone to show them how to
align a system. I was lucky in my training because both my
undergraduate and graduate programs were in centers dedicated to the
study of optics and optical engineering. Resources were
plentiful. But for a biologist working with a custom microscope
using multiple laser lines, finding someone who is competent in
optics to help realign their system can be highly unlikely.
</p>

<p>
So how can people who don't have a background in optics be trained
in alignment? I'm certain that written tutorials are <i>not</i> the best
tool, since aligning an optics setup is a very hands-on job. But, a
tutorial that makes explicit the principles of alignment might make
a good starting point for others.
</p>

<p>
What are these principles? Below is my rough, initial list that
applies to aligning laser beams. Aligning incoherent systems is
another beast altogether.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The angle of the beam propagation is just as important as the
position of the beam in a plane perpendicular to the table. In
other words, just because a beam is going through a stopped-down
iris doesn't mean it's traveling where you think it is.
</li>
<li>You need to measure the beam position in two planes to determine
its angle of propagation.
</li>
<li>Use "layers of abstraction" to divide sections of the setup into
independent units.
</li>
<li>Use paired mirrors to get enough degrees of freedom to establish
these abstraction layers.
</li>
<li>Design feedback mechanisms into the system. In other words, keep
some irises or alignment marks on the walls in place to aid in
future realignments.
</li>
</ol>

Well, I've finally got this site off the ground… more or less.
</p>

<p>
This website is the continuation of my blog, <a href="http://quadrule.blogspot.com">My Quad-Ruled Life</a>. On
that site, I explored a number of topics as a graduate student in
optics, while improving my writing as well. As the site progressed
and I matured academically, I found that I was blogging less often,
but still used the blog as a means of exploring ideas. Additionally,
I desired a place to present notes and code to the public in an
easily accessible and open manner.
</p>

<p>
So, after discovering <a href="http://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> and <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, I quickly hashed
together a fully homemade site that allowed me to keep writing blog
posts and to present some of the fruits of my research freely on the
internet.
</p>

<p>
I hope you'll find this site useful as a learning resource and as a
means to get to know me better as a scientist.
