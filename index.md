	<p>Dr. Kyle M. Douglass is a researcher specializing in optical
	sensing, microscopy, and statistical data analysis with
	applications in soft matter and fundamental cell
	biology. Currently, he is working at the EPFL where he is
	developing high-throughput, super-resolution fluorescence
	microscopy technologies for investigating the structural biology
	of genes and organelles. He is financially supported by a

  <h3>August 28 - September 1, 2016</h3>

   <p>Kyle is giving a poster presentation on his work developing a
   new microscope illumination system for large field of view single
   molecule imaging at <a href="http://smlms.epfl.ch/">SMLMS 2016</a>
   in Lausanne, Switzerland. This will be followed by another poster
   presentation and lightning talk at <a
   href="http://www.systemsx.ch/events-education/events/all-systemsxch-day/">All
   SystemsX.ch Day</a> in Bern, Switzerland on September 1.

  <h3>May 25-27, 2016<h3>

   <p>Kyle will give a short presentation on his recent work
   concerning quantitative fluorescence imaging of telomeres at the <a
   href="http://icrea-bionanovision2016.com/">ICREA BioNanoVision
   conference</a>. The presentation will be on Day 3, May 27 at 10:00
   am.</p>

  <h3>February 17-18, 2016</h3>

   <p>Attended a two day workshop hosted by SystemsX and <a
   href="http://www.hfp-consulting.de/">hfp consulting</a> on
   leadership skills for scientists. The workshop took place in
   Gerzensee near Bern, Switzerland.</p>

  <h3>February 4, 2016</h3>

   <p>Attended the Swiss Photonics Machine Learning Workshop in
   Neuchâtel, Switzerland. You can read my <a
   href="posts/thoughts-from-the-swiss-photonics-machine-learning-workshop.html">thoughts
   about it here</a>.</p>

  <h3>January 19, 2016</h3>

   <p>Uploaded the <a
   href="../kmdouglass_teachingtoolkit_1.pdf">Teaching Toolkit I
   Certificate of Completion</a>. This document certifies that Kyle
   completed EPFL's Teaching Toolkit I, a workshop on university
   teaching strategies. Topics included asking questions to further
   students' understanding, using spaced-repetition effectively, and
   classroom management.</p>

"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142949">Correction
of a Depth-Dependent Lateral Distortion in 3D Super-resolution
Imaging</a>

<p>In this paper, my co-authors and I investigated the source of a
common aberration in 3D localization microscopy. We found that it is
caused by aberrations in the microscope's pupil function that lack
rotational symmetry and provide open-source software to correct this
aberration.</p>

Passive Optical Mapping of Structural Evolution in Complex Fluids</a>

<p>This paper is the result of many years of work during my PhD. We
detailed the development of a low-coherence, fiber optic-based system
for measuring the structural dynamics of complex polymer
solutions. Furthermore, we demonstrated the capabilities of this
system in an industrial triblock copolymer solution by measuring
relaxation times spanning several orders of magnitude and scattering
regimes from single scattering to heavy multiple scattering, which is
a significant improvement over traditional dynamic light scattering
methods.</p>

<a href = "https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-38-14-2385">Dipole–dipole interaction in random electromagnetic fields</a>

<p>This is a theortical paper in which my co-authors and I predict an
optical binding force between two induced dipoles in a random speckle
field. This counter-intuitive result is related to the Casimir effect
and was experimentally demonstrated <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150622/ncomms8460/full/ncomms8460.html">here</a>.</p>
