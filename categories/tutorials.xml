&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paraxial optics is a tool to aid in building optical systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paraxial optics solves the imaging problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The imaging problem concerns finding the location, size, and
orientation of an image given an object and an optical system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An optical system is a collection of objects like lenses, mirrors,
prisms, cameras, etc. that collects the light emitted or scattered
by an object and delivers it to another location where it can be
detected and processed for information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rules of paraxial optics allow for a perfect imaging system,
i.e. a system that creates a one-to-one correspondance between
points in an object plane and an image plane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="paraxial-optics-solves-the-imaging-problem"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paraxial optics solves the imaging problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will use paraxial optics to mean paraxial geometrical optics. This is important
since the paraxial approximation can also apply to the wave theory of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When learning a new theory, I often find it most useful to first identify the problem that the
theory was developed to solve. This approach is particularly pertinent for learning paraxial
optics, since the theory is largely used as a tool to aid in the construction of optical
systems. Unfortunately, the fact that paraxial optics can help solve problems often becomes lost on
people because they never actually build anything for the purpose of imaging. And even if a someone
never builds a camera or microscope, I think it is difficult for them to see what paraxial optics
concepts--such as principle planes and aperture stops--can do for helping them troubleshoot their
hardware when it is not working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with this in mind, I will use this part in a series of blog posts to answer the following
question: what is the problem that paraxial optics solves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paraxial optics solves the imaging problem [1]. The imaging problem as I see it is simply this:
&lt;em&gt;given an optical system, how can one arrange its components to form the image of an object at a
desired&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;position and with a predictable size and orientation?&lt;/em&gt; This question has been asked by
scientists, engineers, philosophers, and others since antiquity because we place enormous value in
pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand this problem, I am going to step through the parts of this statement and
explain what I mean by each. First, I mention that the imaging problem involves the use of an
&lt;em&gt;optical system&lt;/em&gt;. I have to admit that I use this term partly because it is part of the jargon of
the optical sciences, but I also think that the word "system" nicely captures the essence of what I
would like to say. An optical system is a collection of components such as lenses, mirrors, and
prisms taken together with their mechanical supports and arranged in a meaningful way to capture
and channel light as it travels from one place to another. Below is one example of an optical
system that most people know pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A human eye is an optical system! From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye#/media/File:Eye_iris.jpg, Peter NÃ³vak, Wikipedia." class="align-center" src="http://kmdouglass.github.io/images/eye.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already mentioned that the components of an optical system can include things we commonly
associate with optics, such as lenses and mirrors, but really no one such component is necessary to
build an optical system so long as it captures and does something with light. For example, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera"&gt;the
pinhole camera&lt;/a&gt; uses nothing but a very small hole
to form images; no lens is required! Still, we usually find some components like lenses much more
frequently in optical systems than others, and the choice of which components to use really just
depends on the specific type of imaging problem you are trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next in the statement of the imaging problem I say that we will be forming an image by arranging
the components of our optical system in a clever way. Though the intuitive notion of an image is
quite clear, I think it is actually extremely difficult to formally define it. For the purpose of
this tutorial, I think it is best at this point to rely on the intuitive idea of an image until I
have developed enough concepts to define it in terms of optical theory [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the imaging problem involves determining the location, size, and orientation of an image
formed by the system. This means that rearrangement of our system's components is going to change
these features of the image. Things such as the size of a CCD chip or the weight of a lens are
going to place constraints on the values these properties can take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="perfect-imaging-systems"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perfect imaging systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I should stress that paraxial optics is not the only theoretical tool for solving the
imaging problem. We clearly can use non-paraxial geometrical optics or wave optics to determine the
properties of an image formed by an optical system. However, what is interesting is that paraxial
optics is one of very few theoretical frameworks in which a perfect image can be realized [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Perfect optical system" class="align-center" src="http://kmdouglass.github.io/images/im_perfectOpticalSystems.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above figure, which is called a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.edmundoptics.com/TechSupport/resource_center/downloads/Anchor-Optics/GraphicalRayTracing.pdf"&gt;ray-trace diagram&lt;/a&gt;,
illustrates what I mean by a perfect imaging system. The system is represented as a "black box"
that collects light coming from a two-dimensional plane (known as the object plane) and relays the
light to another plane known as the image plane. The whole system is considered to be rotationally
symmetric about a line called the optics axis so that I can represent it as a two-dimensional
sketch instead of requiring a full, three-dimensional model. Finally, light is modeled as lines
with arrows denoting the direction of propagation [4].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the important point. Within the framework of paraxial optics theory, it is possible to
show that, given an object plane and an image plane, one can construct an optical system consisting
of components that redirect the light rays in such a way that all the rays leaving a point in the
object plane are brought back together at a corresponding point in the image plane. &lt;em&gt;This means
that the perfect optical system performs a one-to-one mapping of points in the object&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;plane to
points in the image plane&lt;/em&gt;. What's more, the distance between every point in the image plane and
the optics axis is proportional to the distance between their corresponding points and the axis in
the object plane by a constant factor. This factor is known as the &lt;em&gt;magnification&lt;/em&gt; of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this perfect imaging system is realized within the context of the theory is in the way the
components redirect the rays coming from the object [5]. What differentiates /paraxial/ geometrical
optics from plain old geometrical optics is the rules dictating how the redirection occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other important point is to consider what happens in imperfect imaging systems. Once we violate
the assumptions of paraxial optics so that we no longer have a system operating within its range of
validity, we cannot perform a true, one-to-one mapping of points from the object plane to the image
plane. Instead, we find that rays coming from a single point in the object plane cannot all be
brought back together in any image plane [6]. We could say that the image plane is a concept that
does not exist outside paraxial optics. And if the image plane does not exist, how are we to
strictly define an image size and location?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we can find planes in non-paraxial systems in which there are pretty good images, and
these usually correspond to the image planes we find by applying the equations and simplifications
of paraxial optics. So paraxial optics is often our first tool for modeling an imaging system. It
tells us roughly where our images will be formed and how big they are, but it will not tell us
about image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this tutorial I hope to have provided you with a conceptual basis for understanding paraxial
geometrical optics without including too many of its details. I think a conceptual basis such as
this is much better than diving right into ray-trace diagrams with lenses and mirros. I think new
students to optics often wonder what the importance is of paraxial optics and why it is needed when
more complete optical descriptions exist. I hope that the discussion of the perfect imaging system
and its existence only within the framework of paraxial geometrical optics helped to clarify its
importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You didn't expect me to give you the answer right away, didyou? :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"&gt;Even the Wikipedia entry on the concept of an Image&lt;/a&gt; is a bit vague and philosophical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maxwell's Fisheye lens is another, but it is a good deal more complicated and, to my knowledge,
has not been demonstrated at optical wavelengths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's important to realize that we are modeling the propagation of light as a ray; we are not
saying that light is a ray. If light really was a ray and not an electromagnetic wave, then we
would not need the wave theory of optics to explain phenomena like diffraction. Within the
framework of the axioms of geometrical optics, a ray adequately describes how light propagates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More specifically, it lies in the linearization of Snell's law, but I won't get into that yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This phenomenon is precisely what an optical aberration is within geometrical optics theory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Douglass</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a microscopist who designs and builds custom microscopes, I often find that first order ray
tracing is one of the most useful tools I have. It is most useful to me when I am starting a design
or for checking that I have not made any serious logical blunders when working at the bench. I also
find it to be a good teaching tool and excellent for communicating my designs to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have recently made a lot of back-of-the-envelope ray trace designs for a microscope I am
building at work, I have begun to critically think about why ray tracing works so well and how it
fits inside the structure of the physical theories of optics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray tracing is a technique derived from &lt;em&gt;paraxial geometrical optics&lt;/em&gt; and really is just a
consequence of the axioms and assumptions in the development of the theory. When I think back to
when I first learned about paraxial optics, however, I am reminded of severe assumptions that place
limits on the scope of its validity. So how can a theory that makes such an enormous simplification
by treating the electromagnetic waves described by Maxwell's equations as lines obeying the rules
of geometry still be so useful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this next series of blog posts, I want to explore this question and take the time to relearn
paraxial optics with the benefit of hindsight. Physicists typically learn paraxial optics as their
first theory of optics because it is relatively easy as compared to electromagnetism and quantum
optics. I am curious what aspects of the theory I can appreciate now that I am familiar with the
more advanced optical theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture below might also provide a bit of motivation for why this interests me: we physicists
learn about optics theories in a direction of increasing complexity during our education. However,
this approach also means that we learn the most general theories last, so it is not obvious why
assumptions and approximations are made in the theories we learn first. The result, I think, leads
to a bit of logical discordance in our minds that can prevent a clear understanding of the
subject. With this series of posts I hope to remove this cognitive dissonance and improve my
understanding of the field I work in.&lt;/p&gt;
